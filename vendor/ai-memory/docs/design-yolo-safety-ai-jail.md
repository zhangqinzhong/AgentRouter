# Design: safer `--yolo` and ai-jail integration

Status: accepted (release/2.5). Tracks the 2.5 feature that makes
`ai-memory run … --yolo` warn before it disarms an agent's safety prompts,
offers to run the session inside [ai-jail](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-jail)
when it is usable, and adds an opt-in "true yolo" that implies `--yolo` and,
for Claude Code, also forces `bypassPermissions` over a settings `defaultMode`.

## Motivation

`--yolo` maps to each harness's dangerous-mode flag (`apply_yolo`;
Claude → `--dangerously-skip-permissions`). That is a loaded footgun: it runs
every tool call with no confirmation. Three gaps:

1. **No warning.** A user types `--yolo` and the agent is immediately
   unsupervised, with no reminder of what that means or a way to back out.
2. **No sandbox nudge.** ai-jail exists precisely to contain an unsupervised
   agent, but nothing connects the two — the user must remember to type
   `ai-jail ai-memory run …` themselves.
3. **Claude still pauses.** Even with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Claude
   Code still prompts on explicit `permissions.ask` rules and on its own
   command-safety checks (e.g. "Contains brace with quote character (expansion
   obfuscation)"), so an "unattended" yolo run can stall. Anthropic documents
   these under "Actions no mode auto-approves": no permission mode — including
   `bypassPermissions` — skips them.

## Non-goals

- Changing default (non-`--yolo`) behavior. Everything here is gated on
  `--yolo`, except the explicit `--jail` flag (§5), which a user types to ask
  for a jailed run.
- Modifying ai-jail. Detection uses ai-jail's *existing* observable surface
  (see "Already inside ai-jail"). No companion change is required.
- Prompting in any non-interactive path. The warning/offer only appear on a
  real TTY (hook, CI, detached, and piped runs are untouched).

## The four parts

### 1. Yolo warning prompt (all OSes)

Before `apply_yolo` runs in `run.rs`, when `--yolo` is requested **and** the
session is interactive (`stdin` and `stderr` are both terminals — the same
gate the native-session picker already uses) **and** we are not already inside
ai-jail:

```
⚠  --yolo runs every tool call with no confirmation. An agent can delete
   files, run any command, and reach the network unsupervised.
   Proceed? [Y/n]
```

Short, glanceable, `Enter` = yes. A `n`/`no` aborts before the agent spawns
(exit non-zero, nothing launched). EOF/empty ⇒ yes (the default), because a
bare `Enter` is the common case. This never fires in a non-TTY path, so
scripts, hooks, and CI keep working unchanged.

### 2. ai-jail detect + offer (Linux/macOS)

The offer appears only when accepting it can actually work
(`usable_ai_jail`): on Linux or macOS, with the ai-jail binary on `PATH`
(fallback `~/.local/bin/ai-jail`) **and** its sandbox backend on `PATH`
(`bwrap` on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS). It never appears on Windows, where
ai-jail is unsupported, even if a file named `ai-jail` happens to be on `PATH`.
When ai-jail is not usable there is no question at all — the run proceeds
directly after the §1 warning. The re-exec runs the exact path this check
resolved, never a bare `ai-jail` re-looked-up through `PATH` (which missed a
`~/.local/bin`-only install after the user had already accepted).

When usable and we are not already jailed, the prompt gains a second question:

```
ai-jail is installed. Re-run this session inside it? [Y/n]
```

On yes, ai-memory re-execs itself under ai-jail instead of spawning the agent
directly:

```
ai-jail --network --agent-state --no-save-config \
        --env AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL --env AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL \
        --env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --env CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN \
        --env CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR --env … \
        -- <current_exe> run <harness> … --yolo
```

- **`--` before the wrapped command.** ai-jail refuses one of its own flags
  appearing after the command, because it cannot tell whether
  `ai-jail cmd --network` means the sandbox or the child. `ai-memory run`
  shares flag names with ai-jail (`--env`, …), so without the separator a
  forwarded `run claude --env GH_TOKEN=…` aborted the launch. After `--`
  ai-jail passes everything to the wrapped command verbatim — from ai-jail
  2.4.2; earlier releases' guard ignores `--` (despite its error text
  suggesting it), so a colliding forwarded flag still fails there. ai-memory
  emits the separator regardless, as the documented contract.

- **Re-exec**, not a nested spawn: `std::env::current_exe()` + the original
  `args_os()`. ai-jail forwards the wrapped argv verbatim and already parses
  `ai-memory run <harness>` (it keeps both the `ai-memory` binary and the
  native harness visible under its private home), so the nested launch works.
- **`--network` (not `--allow-host`).** ai-jail only adds `--unshare-net` when
  network is *off* (`bwrap.rs`: `if !network_enabled { push("--unshare-net") }`),
  so `--network` shares the host network namespace and the host-side ai-memory
  server on `127.0.0.1:49374` — which the managed run and the agent's hooks
  both need — is reachable. Filtered `--allow-host` uses a private netns with a
  CONNECT proxy for *external* hosts only, so it would cut the loopback server
  off; we deliberately do not use it. This is soft protection (full egress),
  which is acceptable: the agent needs outbound network for its own model API
  regardless, and an agent with no access is useless.
- **Env passthrough.** ai-jail clears the environment by default and re-adds a
  minimal allowlist, so `AI_MEMORY_*`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and provider tokens
  are **not** inherited. ai-memory forwards the ones it set (server/hook URL,
  the token vars it already threads) with `--env NAME`. Only names that are
  actually set in the current environment are forwarded.
- **`--no-save-config`** so ai-jail never writes these flags into the
  project `.ai-jail` (§5).
- **`--agent-state`** so the harness's own login/credentials persist across the
  private home.

If the user declines the ai-jail offer but confirmed `--yolo`, the run
proceeds unjailed (their choice, already warned).

### 3. Already inside ai-jail (skip the warning, avoid double-wrap)

ai-jail exports **no** dedicated sentinel env var, and we chose not to add one
(keeps the two projects decoupled). Detection uses ai-jail's existing
observable surface, per OS:

- **Linux:** ai-jail always sets a fresh UTS namespace with hostname
  `ai-sandbox` (`bwrap.rs`, unconditional). Read `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`
  (or `uname`/`gethostname`) and compare. Reliable.
- **macOS:** seatbelt has no UTS namespace, so the hostname is unchanged.
  ai-jail forces `PS1` to begin with `(jail) ` on both backends; on macOS that
  is the available signal. Weaker (a shell can overwrite `PS1`), but it only
  ever *suppresses* the warning — a false negative just shows the warning
  again inside the jail, which is safe; a false positive is unlikely because
  ai-memory is exec'd directly by ai-jail, not through an interactive shell
  that would reset `PS1`.
- **Windows:** ai-jail is unsupported, so this always returns "not jailed";
  the ai-jail offer is never shown.

When detected as already jailed, both the warning and the ai-jail offer are
skipped and the run proceeds directly — a user who typed
`ai-jail ai-memory run … --yolo` sees no extra friction.

### 4. Claude "true yolo" (opt-in, all OSes; recommended only under ai-jail)

Opt-in `[run] claude_true_yolo` (config) / `--true-yolo` (flag) additionally,
**for the Claude harness only**, injects
`--settings '{"permissions":{"defaultMode":"bypassPermissions"}}'` on the
Claude argv. CLI-flag precedence sits above user and project settings, so a
`defaultMode` there (e.g. `auto` or `acceptEdits`) cannot narrow the run.

What it deliberately does **not** claim to do, verified against Claude Code
2.1.280 and its documentation:

- It cannot silence an explicit `ask` rule. Claude Code enforces `ask` and
  `deny` rules in every permission mode, and `--settings` permission arrays
  *union* with the user/project/local scopes instead of replacing them, so an
  empty `ask` array there is a no-op (earlier releases injected one). To run
  without those pauses, remove the `ask` rules from your own settings; `deny`
  rules never pause — they block — so keeping them costs no interruptions.
- It cannot skip Claude Code's built-in command-safety checks.
- Earlier releases also set three `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_*RM*` environment
  variables. Claude Code reads none of them (they are absent from its binary
  and its env-var reference), so they were removed rather than left implying a
  protection that never existed.

True-yolo is documented as "best paired with a clean sandbox," i.e. ai-jail.

Off by default. **`--true-yolo` is a superset of `--yolo`**: it implies
`--yolo` (the §1 warning, the §2 offer, and each harness's dangerous-mode
mapping) and adds the Claude extras above, so passing both is redundant but
harmless. For every non-Claude harness it is simply interchangeable with
`--yolo`. Like `--yolo`, it is recognized anywhere after `run` — including
after native arguments (`run claude --model opus --true-yolo`), where clap
leaves it in the native argv — and never forwarded to the harness as an
unknown flag.
The `claude_true_yolo` config key only upgrades a launch that is already
`--yolo`/`--true-yolo`; on its own it never turns an ordinary run into a
permission-bypassing one without the warning.

### 5. Choosing what the jail exposes: `--jail`, `--no-jail`, the checklist

ai-jail keeps credentials and host devices out by default and exposes each
through a boolean toggle (`--X` / `--no-X`). A jailed agent that cannot reach
`gh`, the AWS CLI, or an SSH key often cannot finish the task, so the user
picks what the jail mounts — from the CLI or an interactive checklist — and
pressing Enter does the friendly thing.

**CLI.** Two wrapper flags on `ai-memory run` (and recognized after native
arguments too, like `--yolo`; neither ever reaches the harness):

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--jail` | Re-run inside ai-jail now, without the "Re-run inside it?" question or the checklist, using the smart defaults below. |
| `--jail=github,aws,no-mise` | Same, with exactly the listed toggles; `no-X` forces one off (`--no-X`), and every checklist row this host shows that the list does not name is forced off too. |
| `--jail=all` / `--jail=none` | Every checklist row this host shows on / every one of them off. Lists are applied left to right, so `all,no-docker` works. |
| `--no-jail` | Never re-run inside ai-jail; the `--yolo` warning still shows. Conflicts with `--jail`. |

`--jail` needs `=` for its list (`require_equals`), so `ai-memory run --jail
claude` keeps `claude` as the harness. It works with or without `--yolo` and
in non-interactive runs too — that is how a script gets a jailed run. When
ai-jail is not usable on the host (§2) it fails with an error instead of
silently running unjailed. An explicit `--jail` re-execs *before* the managed
run is prepared, so no lease is opened and cancelled outside the jail. Inside
ai-jail (§3) both flags are ignored: no nesting, no error.

There are deliberately **no bare `--github`-style flags** on `ai-memory run`.
They would collide with harness-native flags of the same name (Claude Code
has its own `--worktree`), and wrapper flags after the harness name are
stripped from the native argv — a bare `--worktree` meant for Claude would be
silently taken away from it. The single namespaced `--jail=` list has no such
collision.

**Toggles.** The table (`JAIL_TOGGLES` in `ai-memory-workstream/src/jail.rs`):

| Toggle | Kind | Checklist | Smart default (Enter / bare `--jail`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github` (`~/.config/gh`) | credential | when that directory exists | on when present |
| `aws` (`~/.aws`) | credential | when present | on when present |
| `kube` (`~/.kube`) | credential | when present | on when present |
| `gcloud` (`~/.config/gcloud`) | credential | when present | on when present |
| `docker-config` (`~/.docker/config.json`) | credential | when present | on when present |
| `ssh` (`~/.ssh` read-only + `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) | credential | when `~/.ssh` exists or an agent socket is set | on only when `origin` is SSH-style (`git@host:…`, `ssh://…`) |
| `worktree` | capability | only in a linked git worktree | on there |
| `docker` (socket — ⚠ grants host root) | capability | always | off |
| `gpu`, `display` | capability | Linux only | off |
| `pictures`, `tailscale` | capability | always | off |
| `audio`, `x11`, `host-shm`, `terminal-passthrough`, `update-check`, `mise`, `toolchains` | capability | never (`--jail=` only) | not passed |

Why these defaults: every credential is pre-checked when present because a
user who keeps `gh` or AWS credentials on the machine almost always wants the
agent able to use them, and a box shown only when the path exists never mounts
nothing. The credential rows check the exact path ai-jail mounts — `GH_CONFIG_DIR`
is not consulted, because ai-jail 2.5.0 mounts `~/.config/gh` regardless. SSH
is shown but left unchecked for an HTTPS remote, since only an SSH `origin`
makes `git push` need it. `worktree` is pre-checked in a linked worktree,
where without its metadata mounted writable the agent cannot commit. The host
capabilities stay off: they widen the sandbox without being needed for the
usual task.

**Semantics: an explicit selection is exact.** ai-jail's own config can
enable toggles too — the trusted global `~/.ai-jail` may turn on, say,
`docker`. So whenever the user makes a selection, ai-memory states every
visible row explicitly, and ai-jail's CLI flags override its config:

- **Interactive checklist:** every row the user saw is passed as marked —
  checked `--X`, unchecked `--no-X` (`marked_choices`). An unchecked
  `[ ] Docker socket` stays off even when `~/.ai-jail` enables it; the
  checklist is what-you-see-is-what-you-get.
- **`--jail=LIST`, including `none`:** the named entries, in order (later
  entries win), then `--no-X` for every visible checklist row the list did
  not name. "Exactly what it names" holds against any ai-jail config, and
  `none` means none of the checklist rows. Rows that are not visible are never
  forced: an absent credential mounts nothing either way, and CLI-only toggles
  stay out of the invocation unless named.
- **Bare `--jail`:** the user saw no selection, so it only enables the
  smart-default rows (`checked_choices`) and emits nothing for the rest; the
  user's own ai-jail configuration still decides those.

The chosen toggles are emitted after the
`--network --agent-state --no-save-config --env …` baseline and before the `--`
separator.

**A project `.ai-jail` replaces the checklist.** ai-jail reads its project
config only from the invocation directory, which the re-exec inherits from
ai-memory. When a regular file `.ai-jail` exists there:

| | no project `.ai-jail` | project `.ai-jail` present |
|---|---|---|
| offer accepted (no flag) | checklist; every row passed as marked | no checklist, no toggles: the file is loaded as-is |
| bare `--jail` | smart-default rows on; the rest left to ai-jail config | no toggles: the file is loaded as-is |
| `--jail=LIST` | exactly the list; unnamed visible rows `--no-X` | the same exact list, on top of the file (CLI flags override config in ai-jail) |

A project file is untrusted — it lives in the repository the agent works on.
ai-jail lets it disable capabilities but never enable credentials, `docker`,
`agent_state`, and the like, so ai-memory must not pre-check anything on its
behalf either, and an untrusted repository must not be able to steer the
checklist. Only the file's presence is probed (`JailHostFacts::project_config`);
its contents are never read or parsed. The global `~/.ai-jail` is not
consulted: ai-jail writes it for its status-bar preferences, so most users have
one. To get credentials mounted automatically alongside a project `.ai-jail`,
enable them in the trusted global `~/.ai-jail` or pass `--jail=github,…`,
because the project file cannot enable them.

**Why every re-exec passes `--no-save-config`.** On every ordinary run (not
`--dry-run`, not lockdown, saving not disabled) ai-jail merges its CLI flags
into the project config and writes `.ai-jail` back. Without the flag, the
first jailed run would persist ai-memory's transient flags (`--network`,
`--agent-state`, the checked credentials) into the user's repository; every
later run would then find a project file, skip the checklist, and silently
lose the credential mounts a project file cannot enable — and ai-jail would
warn that the project file's `agent_state` is ignored because it weakens the
baseline sandbox. `--no-save-config` sits in the baseline next to `--network`
/ `--agent-state`, before the `--`, guarded by the same `--help` detection (both
2.4.1 and 2.5.0 have it). It is reserved: `--jail=save-config` is refused.

**Checklist.** Without either flag and without a project `.ai-jail`, after the
user accepts the §2 offer, the rows visible on this host are listed with their
smart defaults:

```
Enable in the jail (Enter = as marked; numbers flip, e.g. "2 4"; "all" / "none"):
  [x] 1) GitHub CLI credentials        ~/.config/gh, read-only
  [x] 2) AWS credentials               ~/.aws, read-only
  [ ] 3) SSH keys + agent              ~/.ssh read-only + SSH_AUTH_SOCK; needed for git over SSH
  [ ] 4) Docker socket                 ⚠ grants host root
>
```

Enter (or EOF) accepts as marked; row numbers (spaces or commas) flip rows and
redraw the list; `all` / `none` set every row. An unrecognized answer changes
nothing and re-prompts; the third one aborts the launch rather than guessing
what to mount. One summary line then names what the jail gets, grouped into
credentials, capabilities, and the user's own `no-X` entries, then "everything
else in the checklist off" for the rows an explicit selection left out (rather
than spelling out each `--no-X`). With no visible row the
checklist is skipped. The reader takes injected `BufRead`/`Write`, like the §1
prompt, so its grammar is unit-tested without a TTY.

**Decision table** (`jail_decision` in `run.rs`):

| | already jailed | `--no-jail` | `--jail[=…]` | neither |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--yolo` warning (interactive only) | no | yes | yes | yes |
| ai-jail | no (no nesting) | never | re-exec now; error if not usable | offer + checklist when interactive and usable (no checklist with a project `.ai-jail`) |

**Version requirements.** ai-jail rejects an unknown flag, so ai-memory only
passes flags the *installed* ai-jail supports. It runs `<ai-jail> --help` once
and treats a toggle as supported only when the exact token `--X` appears
(tokens split on whitespace and `/`; never a substring match, so `--docker`
and `--docker-config` stay distinct). Unsupported toggles are hidden from the
checklist; one named explicitly in `--jail=` is an error naming the release
that has it. The credential mounts (`github`, `aws`, `kube`, `gcloud`,
`docker-config`) and `toolchains` need ai-jail **2.5.0**; the rest are in
2.4.1.

**Never offered.** `--jail=` refuses the security switches and the flags
ai-memory owns, with "not available through ai-memory; run ai-jail directly":
`private-home`, `lockdown`, `landlock`, `seccomp`, `rlimits`, `systemd-user`,
`inherit-env`, `macos-host-ipc`, `browser`, the audit-log flags (each weakens
or reconfigures the sandbox itself), and `network` / `agent-state` /
`save-config` (set by ai-memory, §2). Someone who needs one runs ai-jail
directly.

**Security notes.**

- A credential mounted into an unsupervised (`--yolo`) agent is usable by it:
  read-only stops it from changing the files, not from using the tokens in
  them. Pre-checking present credentials trades that exposure for a jailed
  agent that can do its job; the checklist shows each one, and `--jail=none`
  or unchecking opts out.
- `docker` grants effective root on the host; it is never on by default and
  its note says so.
- The re-exec still forwards only environment names already set (§2), and
  the toggle flags carry no values or secrets.

## OS support matrix

| Concern | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| ai-jail available | bwrap | seatbelt | unsupported → no offer |
| already-jailed detect | hostname `ai-sandbox` | `PS1` `(jail) ` | always "no" |
| `--network` loopback reach | shared net ns | profile-allowed | n/a |
| warning prompt | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| true-yolo env vars | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (incl. powershell var) |

## Code shape

- `ai-memory-workstream/src/jail.rs` (new): pure, OS-aware, dependency-injected
  detection + command construction — `usable_ai_jail(os, lookup)`,
  `inside_ai_jail(env, hostname)`, `build_ai_jail_invocation(exe, args, env_names)`.
  Pure functions so the OS branches and the argv/env assembly are unit-tested
  without a sandbox.
- `ai-memory-cli/src/commands/run.rs`: the interactive prompt + orchestration
  (gate → warn → offer → re-exec or proceed), reusing the existing
  `is_terminal` gate and a `confirm`-style reader.
- `ai-memory-cli/src/config.rs`: `[run] claude_true_yolo: bool` (default false).
- §5: the toggle table, `--help` support detection (`JailSupport`), host facts
  (`JailHostFacts`, fed by `inspect_repository`'s `origin_url` /
  `linked_worktree`), `jail_checklist`, and `parse_jail_toggles` live in
  `jail.rs`; `run.rs` owns `--jail`/`--no-jail` parsing, the `jail_decision`
  table, and the checklist reader.
- `ai-memory-workstream/src/harness.rs`: `apply_claude_true_yolo(env, args)`
  next to `apply_yolo`.

## Security considerations

- The warning/offer are **TTY-gated**; no new prompt reaches hook, CI,
  detached, or piped paths (mirrors the interactive-lock and native-picker
  gates).
- Re-exec forwards only environment names that are already set; it introduces
  no new secret surface and does not log token values.
- true-yolo is off by default, Claude-only, and documented as sandbox-first.
- Detection failure fails *open* to the safe side: if we cannot tell we are
  jailed, we show the warning (never silently skip it).

## Testing

- `jail.rs` unit tests: installed/not (injected lookup), inside/outside per OS
  (injected env + hostname), invocation assembly (flags, `--env` only for set
  names, current-exe + argv forwarding).
- `run.rs`: prompt gate is off without a TTY; decline aborts before launch;
  already-jailed skips the prompt; the ai-jail offer is absent when ai-jail is
  not found.
- `harness.rs`: `apply_claude_true_yolo` sets the three env vars + the
  `--settings` arg for Claude and is a no-op for other harnesses.
- CHANGELOG `### Added` (minor); support-matrix + cookbook updated in the same
  change.
- §5: `jail.rs` unit tests cover list parsing, support detection against
  2.4.1/2.5.0 help text, and every smart default with an injected `$HOME`;
  `run.rs` tests cover the decision table, flag stripping via a real clap
  parse, and the checklist grammar. `tests/suite/yolo_ai_jail.rs` feeds every
  toggle the real installed ai-jail advertises through `ai-jail --dry-run`;
  `tests/suite/jail_toggles_e2e.rs` runs the built binary with fake
  `ai-jail`/`bwrap`/`claude` and a mock server (including a PTY run of the
  offer + checklist and of `--yolo --no-jail`).
