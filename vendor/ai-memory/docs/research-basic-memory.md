## 1. Purpose & Scope

Basic Memory is a **local-first, MCP-native, Markdown-based personal knowledge graph**. Its tagline is "Your AI never forgets again": notes live as plain Markdown files on disk, both humans (in Obsidian, VS Code) and LLMs (over MCP) read and write them, and a SQLite/Postgres index keeps a knowledge graph in sync.

**The model is explicitly *manual*.** The user (or, more often, the agent in response to the user) calls `write_note`, `edit_note`, `move_note`, etc. There is **no implicit capture** of conversation content. The "How it works" example in `README.md:317-356` is literally *"Ask the LLM to capture it: 'Make a note on coffee brewing methods.'"* The README even prescribes user prompts ("Create a note about our project architecture decisions") as the activation step. Nothing in the codebase auto-saves conversation turns. The closest thing to automation is the `continue_conversation` *prompt* (`src/basic_memory/mcp/prompts/continue_conversation.py:18-90`), which only *retrieves* - it asks the model to search recent activity and load context; it never writes.

## 2. Storage Model

**Both Markdown and SQL, with the files being source-of-truth.** Each note is one Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
type: note
permalink: coffee-brewing-methods
tags: [coffee, brewing]
---
```

The grammar is documented in `docs/NOTE-FORMAT.md` and parsed at `src/basic_memory/markdown/entity_parser.py:1-27` using `markdown-it` plus custom `observation_plugin` and `relation_plugin`. Three semantic primitives:

- **Entity** (one per file): `src/basic_memory/models/knowledge.py:28-149`. Holds `title`, `note_type`, `permalink`, `file_path`, `checksum`, `mtime`, `size`, `entity_metadata` (JSON for custom frontmatter), `external_id` (stable UUID).
- **Observation**: `- [category] text #tag (context)` lines, indexed in the `observation` table (`knowledge.py:220-263`).
- **Relation**: `- relation_type [[Other Entity]]` lines, indexed in `relation` (`knowledge.py:265-311`). Bare `[[X]]` becomes `links_to`. Relations can be *unresolved* (`to_id` NULL until the target exists), then auto-resolved on sync.

**Search** is dual-stack and selected by `database_backend` config (`src/basic_memory/config.py:222-226`):

- **SQLite**: FTS5 virtual table `search_index` with custom tokenizer `'unicode61 tokenchars 0x2F'` so `/` is searchable (`src/basic_memory/models/search.py:62-94`). Semantic vectors via `sqlite-vec` virtual table `search_vector_embeddings` (`search.py:146-153`).
- **Postgres**: real `search_index` table with `tsvector` GIN + `pgvector` (`search.py:17-58`) and `pg_trgm` for fuzzy link resolution (migration `f8a9b2c3d4e5`).

Hybrid search defaults: vector candidates `semantic_vector_k=100`, similarity threshold `0.55`, model `bge-small-en-v1.5` via FastEmbed (`config.py:233-313`). Search type is `hybrid` when semantic is on, else `text` (`config.py:313-318`).

There is also a `NoteContent` table (`knowledge.py:152-217`) that **materializes the markdown body in the DB** with a `file_write_status` state machine (`pending|writing|synced|failed|external_change_detected`) and `db_version`/`file_version` for conflict resolution between AI writes and human file edits.

## 3. MCP Tools Exposed

All tools are registered via the `@mcp.tool` decorator and exported from `src/basic_memory/mcp/tools/__init__.py:9-65`. Every tool is annotated with MCP `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint`/`openWorldHint` so agents can pick safely. Every single tool requires **explicit invocation** - none are triggered by the server itself.

| Tool | Hint | File |
|---|---|---|
| `write_note` | destructive, not idempotent | `tools/write_note.py:21` |
| `edit_note` (append/prepend/find_replace/replace_section/insert_*) | not destructive | `tools/edit_note.py:225` |
| `read_note`, `view_note`, `read_content` | read-only | `tools/read_note.py:64`, `view_note.py:13`, `read_content.py:157` |
| `delete_note` | destructive | `tools/delete_note.py:184` |
| `move_note` | not destructive (updates links) | `tools/move_note.py:346` |
| `search_notes` (advanced: tags, status, metadata_filters, after_date, search_type=text/vector/hybrid) | read-only | `tools/search.py:564` |
| `recent_activity` | read-only | `tools/recent_activity.py:28` |
| `build_context` (resolves `memory://` URIs, walks relation graph N hops, `depth=1..3`) | read-only | `tools/build_context.py:114` |
| `list_directory`, `canvas` (Obsidian canvas), `list_workspaces` | mixed | various |
| `list_memory_projects`, `create_memory_project`, `delete_project` | mixed | `tools/project_management.py` |
| `schema_infer`, `schema_validate`, `schema_diff` (Picoschema over frontmatter) | read-only | `tools/schema.py:206-440` |
| ChatGPT-compat `search` / `fetch` | read-only | `tools/chatgpt_tools.py:107-171` |
| `cloud_info`, `release_notes` | read-only | |

Two MCP **prompts** ship: `continue_conversation` and `recent_activity` (both retrieve-only). There is also a `view_note` UI artifact path.

## 4. Memory Lifecycle

**There is no lifecycle.** Grep'd the entire `src/` tree for `decay|aging|consolidat|summariz|forget|expire|ttl|prune|archive_old` - zero matches outside of unrelated OAuth-token expiry and SQLAlchemy `expire_on_commit`. Notes are **append-only forever** unless a human or agent explicitly calls `delete_note`, `move_note`, or `edit_note`. There is no auto-summarization, no auto-merge of duplicates, no recency weighting in search ranking (only an `after_date` filter), no "cold storage" tier. `recent_activity` (`tools/recent_activity.py:28`) just queries by `created_at`/`updated_at`; it doesn't shape memory.

The only background process is the `WatchService` (`src/basic_memory/sync/watch_service.py:81-145`) + `SyncService` (`src/basic_memory/sync/sync_service.py:153-188`), which reconcile file changes with the DB after a `sync_delay` of 1000 ms (`config.py:338`). That's housekeeping, not lifecycle.

## 5. Cross-Project / Cross-Agent

Projects are a first-class concept. Config holds a `Dict[str, ProjectEntry]` (`config.py:184-195`), each with a `path`, a `mode` (`LOCAL` or `CLOUD` - per-project routing), optional `workspace_id`, and bisync state. A `default_project` is auto-set to the first project (`config.py:705-711`).

**Project resolution is a unified three-tier chain** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:298-324`): explicit `project` argument → default → single-project fallback. Every MCP tool accepts `project` and `project_id` (UUID) parameters. `get_project_client(project, ...)` (`mcp/project_context.py`) routes to local ASGI or cloud HTTP per-project, so you can mix.

For agent handoffs, there is no special handshake - basic-memory treats all MCP clients identically. The "handoff" story is: agent A writes notes to project `foo`, agent B (any other MCP client pointed at the same project) reads them. The Markdown files on disk are the lingua franca. There is no session/agent identifier, no per-agent scratchpad. `created_by`/`last_updated_by` columns exist (`knowledge.py:99-102`) but are populated only in cloud (user_profile_id), null for local/CLI.

## 6. Backup & Portability

- **Default location**: `~/basic-memory` for notes (per `BASIC_MEMORY_HOME` env, README:197), `~/.basic-memory/` for SQLite DB + config (`config.py:24, 67-80`). Config in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`, chmod 0600.
- **Portability**: Excellent for files (they're just Markdown - `git clone`, `rsync`, Syncthing, rclone all work). The DB is a derived index - `bm sync` rebuilds it from the files.
- **Schema migrations**: 22 Alembic migrations in `src/basic_memory/alembic/versions/`, auto-run on startup via `get_or_create_db` (`services/initialization.py:23-38`). Migrations cover both SQLite and Postgres.
- **Importers** for Claude conversations, ChatGPT exports, and `memory.json` (the original MCP "memory" server format) live in `src/basic_memory/importers/`.
- **Cloud sync** uses `rclone bisync` (`config.py:136-138, 164-167`), not a custom protocol - another portable choice.

## 7. Strengths Worth Borrowing

1. **Files are source of truth, DB is derived index.** Survives any DB corruption, plays nice with git, version control, and grep. Bidirectional human/AI editing via file-watcher + checksum.
2. **MCP behavior annotations on every tool** (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, etc., `tools/write_note.py:23`). Agents can plan multi-step actions without trial-and-error.
3. **Aggressive `AliasChoices` aliasing** of parameter names (`write_note.py:31` accepts `directory|folder|dir|path`; `search.py:574` accepts `query|q|search|text`). LLMs use whatever name their training reaches for; the tool absorbs the variance.
4. **`memory://` URI scheme + `build_context` graph walker** (`tools/build_context.py:114-247`) - turns wiki-links into navigable context. Cleaner than dumping the whole graph.
5. **Unresolved relations as first-class state** (`knowledge.py:282`) - `to_id` nullable, resolves later when target appears. Forward references just work.
6. **Per-project routing** with mixed local/cloud modes per project, not per-server.
7. **Composition root + typed-client pattern** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:14-256`) keeps MCP/CLI/API entrypoints clean and testable.
8. **The `NoteContent` table** with `file_write_status` state machine (`knowledge.py:155-217`) handles the race between agent writes and on-disk human edits - worth replicating if you keep a DB cache.

## 8. Weaknesses / Friction (Avoid)

1. **The manual `write_note` ceremony is the headline friction.** Users must explicitly tell the model "make a note about this," and the model must decide *title*, *directory*, *tags*, *note_type*, and the semantic observation/relation grammar - all on every call. The `write_note` signature has 11 parameters (`write_note.py:25-45`). Skip this entirely: capture should be ambient (post-turn summarization, automatic salience scoring, etc.) - not a tool the model must remember to call.
2. **Append-only forever.** No decay, no consolidation, no automatic deduplication. Long-running graphs accumulate cruft. Recent v0.20 added a guard so `write_note` *errors* on conflict instead of silently upserting (`write_note.py:240-262`), which protects data but pushes the burden back onto the agent to manage identity. For agent long-term memory, decay/merge/consolidation is essential and absent here.
3. **The semantic grammar is human-authored convention.** `- [category] text #tag (context)` and `- relation_type [[Target]]` are intuitive for humans in Obsidian but require the LLM to *generate* this format correctly every time. Drift is normal. A Rust server can store edges natively and let the LLM emit prose.
4. **Note identity is brittle.** `permalink` is derived from title/path; renames create work (`update_permalinks_on_move` defaults to `False`, `config.py:349-352`). The 11-column `entity` table + separate `note_content` is a lot of machinery to keep in sync with files.
5. **No agent/session model.** No notion of "who wrote this," "which session," or "what was the user's intent." `created_by` exists only for cloud auth (`knowledge.py:99-102`). For multi-agent handoffs, you'd want provenance baked in.
6. **Search ranking is keyword-or-vector with a fixed `min_similarity=0.55`** (`config.py:307-312`). No recency/importance reranking, no usage feedback, no per-query learning.
7. **The Markdown source-of-truth tradeoff.** Filesystem latency, checksum recomputation, FTS5 rebuilds, and circuit-breaker retry tracking (`sync_service.py:179-281`) are a lot of infrastructure just to keep a DB consistent with files. For agent memory where the files exist only because LLMs wrote them, this is overhead with no payoff - keep the DB as primary and only export Markdown on demand.
8. **Tool surface is wide (~25 tools).** Agents have to pick among `write_note`/`edit_note`/`move_note`/`delete_note`/`read_note`/`view_note`/`read_content`/`search`/`search_notes`/`build_context`/`recent_activity`/`list_directory`/`list_memory_projects`/`canvas`/`schema_*`. Even with hints, that's a lot of context burned describing tools. Aim for a smaller, more orthogonal set.

**Bottom line**: borrow the *graph + observations + wiki-link* primitives, the *memory:// URI* navigation, the *typed-client + composition-root* layering, the *MCP annotations*, and the *file-as-portable-export* idea - but invert the capture model (ambient, not invoked), add a lifecycle (decay/consolidation/summarization), keep the DB primary, add agent/session provenance, and ship a much narrower MCP tool surface.
