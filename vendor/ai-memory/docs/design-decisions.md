## 1. Product shape

A self-contained Rust binary that:

1. Runs as an **MCP server** (stdio + HTTP/SSE) for coding-agent CLIs (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, OpenClaw, OpenCode, OMP, and MCP-capable clients).
2. Captures sanitized, bounded lifecycle observations **automatically** - no `write_note` ceremony - via hook scripts or generated extensions that agent CLIs invoke. User prompts and post-compaction summaries retain at most 16 KiB; notifications and tool excerpts retain at most 2 KB; every sanitized durable body has a 16 KiB backstop. Optional `ai-memory run` workstreams additionally read visible native transcript tails through host-side, read-only adapters.
3. Maintains a **Karpathy-style wiki**: incrementally-compiled markdown pages with cross-links, supersession, an `index.md` and a `log.md`.
4. Serves retrieval via the MCP `tools/list` to coding agents: a handful of *narrow* tools, not 50.
5. Ships a **Docker image** (`docker run -v ai-memory-data:/data -p 49374:49374 ai-memory`) so it can move between desktop and homelab.
6. Is *self-healing*: schema migrations on startup, vector-index dim/provider check, write-ahead durability, periodic integrity audit, single-writer queue to avoid `database is locked`.

## 2. Hard requirements (extracted from the prompt)

- Rust, clean architecture, modular, unit-tested.
- Cargo-format clean.
- Docker-deployable, easy backup, easy move desktop↔homelab.
- MCP server for coding agents.
- **Automatic** memory capture/fetch - minimal manual tool invocations.
- Differentiates **short-term** vs **long-term** memory temporally (like agentmemory).
- Self-healing memory management.
- Helps with handoffs between agent CLIs (resume from Codex where Claude Code left off).
- Iteratively planned - each feature working before the next starts. No dead code.

## 3. Storage model - the biggest architectural decision

Three options surveyed:

| Option | Source-of-truth | DB used for | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. DB-primary** | SQLite | Everything | Single transaction boundary, fast search, no FS race conditions | Opaque to humans; harder backup story |
| **B. Markdown-in-git** primary | Files in repo | Derived index | Diff-able, grep-able, portable, Karpathy-faithful | Watcher correctness (basic-memory #580/#758/#798), inode races (#765), startup cost |
| **C. DB-primary with on-demand export** | SQLite | Everything | Best of both | Two formats to keep coherent; user must remember to export |

**Decision: Option B - markdown in a git repo is source of truth, SQLite is derived index.**

**Why:**
- Backup/move story is trivial - `git clone` or `rsync` a directory. The user explicitly asked for this.
- Karpathy's pattern *is* the wiki on disk. Faking it with an export step loses the inspect-in-Obsidian property.
- DB is rebuildable from files - corruption is recoverable.
- Cross-tool compatibility for free: any agent that reads `~/.ai-memory/wiki/*.md` works without an MCP integration.

**How we avoid basic-memory's watcher pain:**
- Watcher has a heartbeat + reconciliation pass (full diff every 30s to catch missed events).
- We *own* writes through the MCP server's `wiki_write` path; the watcher is a *safety net* for external edits, not the primary input.
- Inode-locking advisory + psutil-style live-process check before destructive ops (`reset`, `purge`). Lesson from basic-memory #765/#776.
- Hidden-directory paths handled explicitly (basic-memory #798).

**How we avoid the "files-and-DB drift" overhead:**
- DB stores `(path, mtime, size, sha256, indexed_at, provider, model, dim)` per page. On startup, fast scan vs. cached SHAs; only changed files re-parsed.
- Embeddings keyed by `sha256(content) + provider + model + dim`. Re-embed only when content changes.

**Consistency contract:** markdown is primary and SQLite is derived. There is no
real cross-resource transaction between the filesystem and SQLite. Wiki writes
must go through `Wiki::write_page`, `Wiki::apply_batch`, or the existing
destructive helpers so sanitization, admission, attribution, rollback, and
store updates stay together. Runtime store failures roll installed files back
best-effort; crash windows are resolved by the existing markdown reindex path.
Handlers must not write wiki files directly.

## 4. Database choice - single SQLite file

**Decision: one SQLite file with FTS5, packed-vector embeddings, and SQL tables for graph edges.**

Why not Postgres/pgvector? Cognee's #2717 and basic-memory's #830/#831 show Postgres is a real-deployment-only pain. v1 ships embedded.

Why not LanceDB/Qdrant/Kuzu/CozoDB/SurrealDB?
- LanceDB: cognee #2702/#2720 (file-format drift, filter propagation failures). Pyarrow underneath.
- Kuzu / Ladybug: cognee #2098/#2768 (upstream archived, fork-risk realized).
- CozoDB: small bus factor.
- SurrealDB: heavy, multi-mode storage; we'd inherit a lot of surface we don't need.
- Packed vectors in SQLite keep v1 dependency-light; `sqlite-vec` remains the scale-up path once brute-force cosine stops being enough.

**The graph is just SQL tables.** A `wiki_pages` table, a `wiki_links (from_id, to_id, link_type)` table, optional `wiki_concepts (page_id, concept)`. Graph queries are recursive CTEs in SQLite. Petgraph in-memory for batch traversals. Avoids the entire "embedded graph DB" footgun cognee fell into.

**Crates** (research-backed picks):
- `rusqlite` for embedded SQLite access. `bundled-sqlcipher` if we want encryption later.
- `refinery` for SQL migrations.
- `tantivy` *not* used initially - sqlite FTS5 is sufficient at the corpus sizes we expect (hundreds to low-thousands of pages per project). Revisit only if FTS5 ranking proves inadequate.
- `petgraph` for in-memory graph algorithms during consolidation.

## 5. Embedding & LLM

**Embeddings:**
- The original prototype proposed a default local `ort` / `fastembed-rs` model. The shipped v1 posture is instead **off by default**, with opt-in OpenAI, Voyage, Google Gemini, or keyless OpenAI-compatible embeddings. The compatible path requires an explicit base URL, model, and dimension because self-hosted engines have no safe common defaults, and it uses a distinct provider identity to prevent vector-family mixing. Local ONNX embeddings remain future work; the current provider and model reference lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Persist `{provider, model, dim}` next to every vector. On mismatch, warn and ignore stale vectors until `ai-memory embed --force` or scheduled backfill re-embeds them (agentmemory #469 lesson, without blocking startup).
- Any future local model cache belongs under `<data_dir>/models/`, never `/tmp` (basic-memory #741).
- The shipped provider implementations share the `Embedder` trait and are selected through typed configuration.

**LLM for consolidation passes:**
- **Off by default**, behaves like agentmemory after #138's fix. Without a provider, the system still works: synthetic compression (rule-based), no LLM-generated summaries, no `memory_consolidate` page-rewrite.
- With a provider, LLM consolidation runs on PreCompact, on demand via `memory_consolidate`, and at session end only when `AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END=true` (off by default). A substantive session end always writes a rule-based summary page + handoff regardless; a session containing only `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` boundaries closes without either artifact or provider work and releases any startup handoff bound to that receiver. SessionEnd provider work is persisted by observation generation and consumed outside the hook request by one bounded retrying worker, so client drain cancellation cannot lose it. The automatic handoff and completed-end watermark commit in one SQLite transaction; an already-ended keyed replay converges the remaining wiki commit, provider enqueue, and ingest-key completion. The completed end also stores the observation count it covered; a resumed session re-enters the end path only after that count advances, avoiding non-convergent wall-clock comparisons. Optional 6h maintenance timer.
- Providers implement `LlmProvider { complete(...); complete_structured(...) }`. The current provider and authentication matrix lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md); this design boundary also covers OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as Ollama, vLLM, and LM Studio.
- **Native HTTP per provider** - no LiteLLM-equivalent. The cognee tracker (#2412/#2430/#2537/#2608/#2749/#2782/#2840/#2842) showed silent-kwarg-drop in a generic gateway is the #1 source of provider bugs. Each provider's typed JSON, errors on unknown fields. Hand-coded but correct.
- **Structured output via JSON schema, not XML, not Instructor-style wrapping.** Use each provider's native JSON-mode where available; for Anthropic, request a tool-use response with a typed schema. Validate with `serde_json` + `schemars`-derived schemas.

## 6. Capture model - auto, never `write_note`

Three capture surfaces, in priority order:

1. **Lifecycle hooks/extensions.** The current clients are listed in the README support matrix. These are fast, reliable, structured. We ship hook scripts or generated TypeScript integrations the user installs once. Lessons from agentmemory:
  - Hooks must be **fire-and-forget** (#221). No `await fetch()` blocking session start.
  - Sub-second hard timeouts on the writer side (`tokio::time::timeout`).
  - All hooks → single HTTP/Unix-socket POST → server queues → returns 202
    immediately, or 429 when saturated.
  - Privacy strip at the hook boundary, not later (agentmemory `stripPrivateData`).

2. **Managed-workstream transcript import** (opt-in through `ai-memory run`). Each supported adapter reads its linked native session after a managed launch and appends portable visible events to the shared ledger. ai-memory does not ship a universal background watcher over private harness stores.

3. **Manual MCP tool** (`memory_write_page`) - only for explicit durable project knowledge from the user ("remember this"). Routine session capture remains automatic.

### Capture-policy boundary (#194)

The nearest `.ai-memory.toml` may use `[capture] ignore_paths` to exclude
recognized file-tool events before client spool or transport. This is a strict,
schema-specific lexical boundary, not a general content or DLP filter: private
patterns and candidates never leave the client, but shell/patch text, aliases,
and non-path-attributable bodies remain outside its scope. The authoritative
grammar, limits, supported integrations, and `--check-capture` affordance are
in [the marker-file reference](marker-file.md#capture-exclusions). It adds no
MCP tool and needs no DB migration. New-client/old-server is safe for file
tools, but under an invalid marker a new client also sends shell calls as
metadata-only, which an older server drops; upgrade the server first. Old
clients retain their previous capture behavior.

## 7. Memory model (temporal)

Adopt agentmemory's tier model **but** keep the surface narrow:

| Tier | What it is | Lifetime | Decay |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Working** | Current session: last N observations, last user prompt, current files | Until session end | Drop on session end (kept in DB for forensics, but excluded from default recall) |
| **Episodic** | Per-session summaries with concept tags, files-touched, decisions made | 30 days hot, 180 days cold, then evict if cold-score < threshold | `salience · exp(-λ · age_days) + σ · log(1 + access_count) · exp(-μ · days_since_access)`. Code of record: [`crates/ai-memory-store/src/decay.rs`](../crates/ai-memory-store/src/decay.rs). |
| **Semantic** | Distilled facts/preferences/architecture notes - the wiki pages themselves | Indefinite, supersedeable | Versioned in place: old `is_latest=false`, new `supersedes=old_id` |
| **Procedural** | Repeated patterns extracted from episodic clusters (`pattern` type with frequency ≥ 2) | Indefinite | Frequency-decay if not re-observed in N days |

**Implementation note:** the four tiers map to one `pages` table with a `tier` enum column + an `observations` table for bounded working/episodic projections, not four separate tables. Keeps schema migrations sane.

**Retrieval authority:** tier is also one bounded signal after relevance
candidate generation. The canonical page-kind classifier, `pinned`, and a
small built-in tag vocabulary (`canonical`, `active`, `source-of-truth`,
`superseded`, `historical`, `test-fixture`, `do-not-answer-from`) join it in a
post-fusion multiplier. This is deliberately not an independent retriever or
an absolute override: it resolves close contests between durable knowledge and
episodic evidence without hiding targeted session/history matches. `pinned`
continues to control retention and automated mutation first; its retrieval
effect alone is small.

## 8. Consolidation (the Karpathy bit)

Three scheduled MCP operations:

- **`memory_ingest`** (auto-called by hooks): one observation → write-fan-out to ~5–15 wiki pages. New page if no match; supersede + version if the page already exists. No-LLM fallback: append to a per-day digest page if no provider configured.
- **`memory_query`** (called by agent on demand): project-scoped FTS + lexical entity + graph retrieval, with optional vectors, RRF-fused before bounded authority and optional LLM reranking. Agentmemory's earlier triple-stream result motivated the fusion shape.
- **`memory_lint`** (scheduled hourly + on session-end): scans for contradictions, orphan pages, broken links, stale claims, low-confidence + zero-reinforcement entries. Pure LLM with strict JSON output.

Decay/forget runs as a separate `memory_forget_sweep` job: applies the retention formula; removes the Markdown source while tombstoning via `is_latest=false` + `superseded_at`; then hard-deletes the tombstone's full version ancestry after the configured grace period. Lifetime access counters influence the retention score before eviction but do not block cleanup afterward. Never silently destroys anything user-pinned, and never path-deletes a newer recreation.

Auto-improvement work stays separate from normal session consolidation. The
reviewer notes and staged design are in
[`docs/auto-improvement-loop.md`](auto-improvement-loop.md). The short version:
learning review is scheduled for newly completed sessions in every project when
an LLM provider is configured, and manual CLI/admin/MCP runs remain available for
catch-up or targeted reruns. Scheduling and approval are separate: `[auto_improve.scheduler]`
controls background review, while `[auto_improve] require_approval = true` keeps
scheduled and manual proposals pending for human approval instead of applying
them automatically. All writes remain scoped through the shared resolver/auth
paths and must not mutate the active agent context mid-turn.

## 9. Cross-agent handoff

A first-class typed protocol, shared state:

```rust
struct Handoff {
    from_agent: String,   // "claude-code", "codex"
    to_agent: Option<String>,
    project_id: ProjectId,
    cwd: PathBuf,
    summary: String,
    open_questions: Vec<String>,
    files_touched: Vec<PathBuf>,
    next_steps: Vec<String>,
    model: String,
    created_at: DateTime,
}
```

MCP tools `memory_handoff_begin` (writes a handoff row tagged `state=open`), `memory_handoff_accept` (acknowledges, returns the handoff content, marks `accepted_by`), and `memory_handoff_cancel` (marks an exact open handoff id expired when it was created by mistake). The user can stop Claude Code, start Codex, and Codex's session-start hook fetches the open handoff for the cwd. On an operator-distinguishing server, delivery is owner-scoped first: callers see their own plus deliberately shared rows; `shared=true` publishes a manual handoff to the project, while root-only `any_owner=true` is the recovery escape hatch for accept/cancel. The cwd is matched by path-boundary (the prior art's check), not exact equality: a handoff left in `/repo` is delivered to a session in `/repo/api`, but never to `/repo-other`. A manual `memory_handoff_begin` handoff is project-wide by cwd and is preferred over the auto SessionEnd handoff so an explicit "where we left off" baton is never shadowed by the heuristic one. Among cwd-eligible automatic handoffs the newest wins, with cwd specificity only breaking timestamp ties, so stale subdirectory context cannot shadow a newer parent-session handoff. Creating an automatic handoff expires prior open automatic handoffs from the exact cwd and owner. Accepting one atomically expires older automatic candidates eligible for that receiving cwd and carrying the same owner; manual, sibling-directory, and other-owner handoffs remain open.

Handoffs are a next-session transfer rather than live inter-agent messaging.
Antigravity CLI exposes `PreInvocation` instead of SessionStart, and it fires
before every model call; only `invocationNum = 0` may perform the destructive
handoff fetch. This keeps a manual handoff created during wind-down open for
the next session instead of feeding it back to the same execution loop.

agentmemory has this informally (`/handoff` skill); we make it explicit from day one because every research report flagged cross-agent as the v0.1 weak spot.

## 10. MCP tool surface - narrow on purpose

basic-memory has ~25 tools, agentmemory has 53. Both have user confusion as a result. The current v1 surface is still deliberately narrow:

| Tool | Purpose | Annotation |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_query` | Search + retrieve, FTS5 + entity + graph + optional vector RRF | read-only |
| `memory_recent` | Most-recently-updated `is_latest=1` pages for the project | read-only |
| `memory_status` | Health, counts, last-consolidation-at | read-only |
| `memory_briefing` | Structured zero-LLM snapshot: 7d/30d windows, pending handoffs, recent pages, `_rules/` | read-only |
| `memory_explore` | LLM-composed prose digest over `memory_briefing`; degrades to JSON without a provider | read-only |
| `memory_handoff_begin` | Mark session boundary, write handoff | destructive |
| `memory_handoff_accept` | Fetch + ack the latest open handoff | destructive |
| `memory_handoff_cancel` | Mark an exact mistakenly-created open handoff expired | destructive |
| `memory_consolidate` | LLM-driven page rewrite (`multi_page=true` for atomic fan-out); target-project `_prompts/consolidation.md` supplies bounded untrusted advisory preferences and `instructions` overrides them once | destructive |
| `memory_auto_improve` | Manual learning review for a completed session; the server also schedules review for new sessions, and manual-review opt-in keeps proposals pending | write |
| `memory_write_page` | Write durable wiki knowledge on explicit user request | destructive |
| `memory_read_page` | Read a full page body by exact path or top search hit | read-only |
| `memory_read_session_observations` | Page through one session's raw hook observations in the resolved scope, body-capped | read-only |
| `memory_delete_page` | Delete a single exact-path page with admission hooks | destructive |
| `memory_feedback` | Record bounded page-quality feedback; adjust episodic retention and flag stale/wrong current versions for lint review | write |
| `memory_forget_sweep` | Retention sweep (M8); wiki-backed eviction below cold threshold; `dry_run=true` previews | destructive |
| `memory_lint` | Rule-based + optional LLM contradiction findings → `wiki/_lint/<date>.md` | destructive |
| `memory_install_self_routing` | Returns the canonical slim CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md routing block, managed Agent Skill payloads, target hints, and overwrite guidance | read-only |

Tool param aliases stay narrow: shipped aliases cover `query|q|search` and
`limit|n|top_k`; project and cwd parameters use canonical names unless the
code adds a concrete alias.

Managed ai-memory Agent Skills are prompt packaging for this tool-routing
guidance only. They are installed as ordinary `SKILL.md` files so agents can
progressively load detailed instructions, but ai-memory does not store durable
memory in them and does not include a runtime skill router.

## 11. Identity & project scoping (3-tuple from day one)

Lesson from basic-memory's v0.20 trauma: `(workspace, project, page_path)`. Even if v1 ships single-workspace, the schema and every API/tool param encodes the full 3-tuple. No retrofits.

Project resolution chain: explicit param → server's default → cwd-based heuristic (match repo root) → error.

**Install-time `project_strategy` default (#128).** `basename(cwd)` stays the v1 default, but an agent shell that `cd`s into a subdirectory and stays there silently forks the rest of the session into a phantom project named after the subdir. A `.ai-memory.toml` marker with `project_strategy = "repo-root"` fixes this (#16, #23, #111) but needs a marker in (or above) every repo; a runtime env-var fallback that the *user* sets was deliberately rejected in #16. `install-hooks --project-strategy repo-root` instead **bakes** the strategy into the generated hook command (and the OpenCode / OMP / OpenClaw plugins) at install time — the same status as the already-baked `AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL` / `--data-dir`, not a user runtime override. This is a client/install-time-only change: the server already parses `project_strategy=repo-root`. A marker's own `project_strategy` / `project` still win, and the default stays `basename` (baking nothing) so existing installs are byte-identical.

## 12. Operability

- **Single binary**, statically-linked where possible. Distroless Docker image. **Absolute data path** by default (`dirs::data_local_dir().join("ai-memory")`); log it loudly on startup (agentmemory #303 lesson).
- **Atomic config**: one `Config::load()` → typed struct, every reader takes `&Config`. No `process.env` double-read paths (agentmemory #456/#469).
- **Write durability**: accepted hook work awaits the SQLite write and appends a
  `log.md` line before that background task finishes. Indexes still commit in
  the same transaction as the data; no detached indexing task runs after the
  write ack (basic-memory #763/#578/#839).
- **Migrations**: `sqlx::migrate!` runs on startup; never inline DDL (basic-memory #727).
- **Schema versioning**: one source of truth for the schema; derived clients/docs. No "update 7 files" checklists (agentmemory AGENTS.md smell).
- **Backup/move**: `ai-memory export <dir>` dumps wiki/ + sqlite snapshot. `ai-memory import <dir>` consumes. Default data dir is portable. Optional: `auto_git_commit = true` config flag → commits the wiki directory on every `memory_lint` run.
- **Self-healing**: startup checks (`memory_diagnose`): vector dim/provider drift, FTS index corruption, orphan pages, broken links, zombie sessions. `memory_heal` auto-fixes the safe subset.
- **Logging**: structured `tracing` with rotating files, capped at N MB. No feedback loops (agentmemory #519).

## 13. Original v1 exclusions (historical)

The initial scope excluded the following. Some, including multi-user auth, the
web UI, and managed Agent Skills, shipped after v1; this list is retained as the
historical decision boundary rather than a current support matrix.

- No multi-tenant auth/RBAC (single-user homelab).
- No web UI / dashboard (use `sqlite3` + `glow`/Obsidian).
- No Postgres backend (revisit if a real homelab user hits scale walls).
- No remote/cloud sync (use git remote on the wiki dir).
- No alternative embedded vector backends (sqlite-vec only).
- No alternative graph DB (SQL recursive CTEs only).
- No multimodal (text only).
- No general "skills" / slash-command bundle in v1 (agentmemory plugin format). The narrow exception is the managed ai-memory Agent Skills that package routing guidance for agents; hooks + MCP remain the product surface.
- No LongMemEval-style benchmark harness in v1 - add in v0.4.

## 14. Mistakes-to-avoid checklist (from issue research)

Top-line rules carved into the codebase:

1. One config-read path (agentmemory #456/#469).
2. Indexes in the same txn as the source-of-truth row (agentmemory #204/#309, basic-memory #763/#578).
3. JSON-schema structured outputs, no XML (agentmemory #492/#539; cognee #2840).
4. Hooks fire-and-forget (agentmemory #221, #143).
5. No background-task index-after-return; either sync or `index_status: pending` (basic-memory #763).
6. 3-tuple identity from day one (basic-memory #783/#834).
7. Vector index records `{provider, model, dim}`; ignore stale vectors and warn on mismatch (agentmemory #469).
8. Embedding cache path absolute, not `/tmp` (basic-memory #741).
9. Watcher heartbeat + reconciliation pass (basic-memory #580/#758/#798).
10. Live-process check before destructive ops (basic-memory #765).
11. Per-provider typed HTTP client; no LiteLLM equivalent (cognee #2840).
12. Idempotent ingest with deterministic id derivation (cognee #2510/#2557/#2633).
13. Single transactional boundary; no implicit graph/vector/relational sync (cognee Section B).
14. Filter propagation tests (cognee #2720 was a recall correctness bug).
15. Default data dir is an absolute canonical platform path (agentmemory #303).
16. No `lru_cache` on configs (cognee #2228/#2853).
17. Datasets/projects are query-time filters, not orchestration-mode-conditional (cognee #2867).
18. LLM has off by default; opt-in via env (agentmemory #138/#143).
19. `cargo deny` for transitive license audits (cognee #2807 - FastEmbed removed for license).
20. Pin upstream native deps; ship a lockfile (agentmemory #555/#540).

## 15. Managed workstreams use a portable ledger, not native format conversion

Managed cross-harness continuity is explicitly opt-in through `ai-memory run`.
Direct Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Crush, Kimi Code, Command Code, Kiro
CLI, OMP, Grok Build CLI, and Antigravity CLI launches retain the existing hook
and single-use handoff behavior. There is
no process-global mode or manual harness switch: the wrapper selects the
current repository/worktree workstream and each adapter applies that harness's
native create/resume syntax.

One logical workstream owns one native session per harness plus an append-only
portable event ledger. We rejected converting a Claude transcript into a fake
Codex rollout (and the inverse): native stores include private, versioned state,
provider-specific records, and integrity assumptions that ai-memory does not
own. Adapters therefore read native stores without modifying them, normalize
only visible messages/completed tools/compaction boundaries, and keep source
and delivery cursors separately. Hidden reasoning and provider-private records
are excluded explicitly.

A renewable single-writer lease resolves precedence and concurrency instead of
attempting bidirectional file synchronization. SessionStart receives a bounded
unseen delta without replacing an explicitly pending handoff. When both exist,
the curated handoff is rendered first and their delivery claims commit
atomically after the complete startup response is assembled. The full visible
ledger stays searchable. Repository checkpoints are evidence at run boundaries
and never commit, stash, reset, or otherwise mutate the checkout. The markdown
wiki remains the durable knowledge surface; the managed ledger is an
operational continuity substrate.

Native-session adoption is restricted to bootstrapping an otherwise-empty
workstream. The interactive launcher may offer recent sessions recorded for the
same canonical checkout, but an explicit new workstream and noninteractive
invocations start fresh. After any harness links a session or contributes
portable history, server-side state disables adoption for every harness. This
prevents a first Codex launch after Claude work from attaching an unrelated old
Codex transcript; it creates a clean Codex session, injects the established
ledger, and resumes that linked Codex session on later returns.

Bare `ai-memory run` treats local timestamps as a bootstrap hint, not global
precedence. Once a workstream is established, the server selects the most
recently linked harness among the locally available candidates. This prevents a
newer obsolete transcript file from overriding the logical workstream. When no
checkout-local candidate exists, bare mode fails before creating server state.

We also rejected automatic private-store rewrites after a checkout directory
rename. Most harnesses persist absolute paths, there is no shared relocation
API, and the server cannot distinguish a moved checkout from another clone of
the same remote. Exact-path discovery and explicit native recovery are safer;
Crush is the exception because its project-local database moves with the tree.

This design follows the harness-format and session-portability experiments in
the companion `ai-babel` research project: semantic continuity is portable,
while exact native context is preserved by resuming that harness's own session.
