# LLM Providers

> Provider configuration for consolidation and embeddings. Moved verbatim from the README front page.

ai-memory runs without an LLM: hooks still capture sessions, search uses
FTS5 + declared entities + graph neighbors, and summaries fall back to
rule-based output. Add an LLM provider
when you want LLM consolidation (on PreCompact, on demand via
`memory_consolidate`, or opt-in at session end with
`AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END`), richer linting, and bootstrap.
Substantive session ends always write a rule-based summary page + handoff either
way. A session containing only `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` boundaries is
closed without a page, handoff, or provider job. When that empty session had
accepted startup context, its session-bound handoff is returned to the open
pool for the next receiver instead of being lost.
When the session-end opt-in is enabled, provider work is durably queued after
those deterministic writes and handled by one bounded server worker, so hook
drain latency does not cancel it. Failed jobs retry with backoff and survive a
server restart. A resumed native session is ended again only after its
observation generation advances; the persisted generation watermark makes
duplicate SessionEnd delivery and system clock skew converge without repeated
provider work. The end watermark and automatic handoff commit atomically, and
an interrupted keyed replay finishes the wiki commit, queue insert, and key
completion without duplicating that handoff. On the next SessionStart, the
newest cwd-eligible automatic handoff wins; accepting it expires older eligible
automatic handoffs without consuming manual or sibling-directory work. A new
automatic handoff also expires prior open automatic handoffs from its exact
cwd, so repeated SessionEnds cannot accumulate there before a receiver starts.

To keep consolidation style project-specific, write
`_prompts/consolidation.md` in that project's wiki. Its body can express
preferences such as "prefer Portuguese titles" or "omit routine CI noise".
Automatic, single-page, and multi-page consolidation use the page; a manual
`memory_consolidate` call can pass `instructions` to override it once. ai-memory
sanitizes and caps the value at 2,000 characters, JSON-encodes it in the user
message, and treats it as untrusted advisory data. It cannot supply facts,
request tool use or disclosure, or override the consolidation schema and
faithfulness rules. TTL-expired preference pages are ignored. With no active
page or argument, no preference block is appended.

Recommended defaults:

| Provider | Default | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Best default for consolidation quality and rule classification. |
| `anthropic-oauth` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use a Claude Pro/Max subscription via `claude setup-token`, no API key. |
| `openai` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Cheaper and faster hosted option. |
| `openai-oauth` | `gpt-5.5` | ChatGPT Pro/Plus/Codex backend via `ai-memory auth login openai-oauth`; no Platform API key. |
| `codex` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Reuse the Codex CLI-owned `auth.json`; access-token refresh remains owned by `codex app-server`. |
| `copilot` | `gpt-5.5` | GitHub Copilot Chat backend via `ai-memory auth login copilot` or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`; requires a Copilot subscription. |
| `gemini` | `gemini-3.5-flash` | Google-hosted option with a generous free tier. |
| `opencode` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | OpenCode Go or Zen via `OPENCODE_API_KEY`. Go is the default endpoint; `AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL` selects Zen. Set `AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL` to an id the chosen endpoint serves. |
| `openai-compat` | no default | OpenRouter, Atlas Cloud, OrcaRouter, Cheaper Inference, API Route, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, and other compatible endpoints. |
| `openai-compat` + `AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | no default (recommended: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`) | Hosted access to a large model catalogue through one key. See [OpenRouter](#openrouter) below and the empirical comparison in [`llm-provider-comparison.md`](llm-provider-comparison.md). |

`openai-oauth` stores a refresh token in `<data_dir>/auth.json` and talks to
the ChatGPT/Codex Responses backend, not `api.openai.com`. For Docker quick
starts, run `ai-memory auth login openai-oauth` with the wrapper so the token
lands in the same `ai-memory-data` volume as the server.

`codex` is independent from `openai-oauth`: it never copies credentials into
ai-memory's data directory and never reads a refresh token or ID token. It
reads only `tokens.access_token` and `tokens.account_id` from
`$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, or from the platform home's `.codex/auth.json` when
`CODEX_HOME` is unset or empty. Each request reloads the file. A first 401 may
trigger one serialized `codex app-server --stdio` recovery followed by one
retry; further 401 responses fail with a reauthentication hint. Override the
binary with `AI_MEMORY_CODEX_EXECUTABLE` when `codex` is not on `PATH`.

```bash
export AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=codex
export AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=gpt-5.6-luna
export AI_MEMORY_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT=medium
ai-memory llm-test --provider codex --model gpt-5.6-luna --prompt "Reply with OK"
ai-memory llm-test --provider codex --model gpt-5.6-luna --structured --prompt "Return a short answer"
```

Codex credential storage mode `file` is supported. `auto` works only when its
effective credential is present in `auth.json`; keyring-only and ephemeral
credentials are not read and produce an actionable missing-auth-file error.
Docker is not configured automatically: the Codex executable, `CODEX_HOME`,
and its credential file must all exist in the same container/environment as
ai-memory.

`opencode` talks to OpenCode's gateway with the `sk-...` key from
`opencode.ai/auth`, read from `OPENCODE_API_KEY` only; it does not fall back
to `LLM_API_KEY`. It defaults to the **Go** endpoint,
`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`: a subscription with a per-model monthly
allowance rather than per-token billing. Set
`AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=https://opencode.ai/zen/v1` (or `llm_base_url` in
`config.toml`) for **Zen**'s pay-per-token catalogue. Model ids are per
catalogue and written plainly (`mimo-v2.5`, `glm-5.3-flash`), not in the
`opencode-go/<model>` form OpenCode's own client config uses. The built-in
default is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; Go ids such as `mimo-v2.5` or `glm-5.3-flash`
come from `AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL`, so set it to an id the endpoint you chose
serves. `gpt-5.6-luna` is sent through the Responses endpoint;
every other model uses Chat Completions. The provider sends the
`x-opencode-session` correlation header OpenCode asks for, one id per logical
operation, and its own `User-Agent`; `AI_MEMORY_LLM_HEADERS` overrides
either. `AI_MEMORY_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` and `AI_MEMORY_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECS`
apply as for every other provider. `AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER` / `llm_provider`
also accept the historical aliases `opencode-zen` and `opencode_zen` for the
same provider (`llm-test --provider` takes only `opencode`); the endpoint is
chosen by the base URL, not the alias.

```bash
export AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=opencode
export AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=mimo-v2.5
ai-memory llm-test --provider opencode --model mimo-v2.5 --prompt "Reply with OK"
```

<a id="openrouter"></a>
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is used through the generic `openai-compat`
provider — the same wiring as Atlas Cloud, OrcaRouter, Ollama, vLLM, and LM
Studio. There is no dedicated `openrouter` provider name, and setting
`AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` fails at startup with
`AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter is not one of anthropic|openai|gemini|openai-compat|...`.
Select it by pointing the compat base URL at OpenRouter and supplying its
`sk-or-v1-...` key through `LLM_API_KEY`:

A minimal working env-file (drop into `~/.config/ai-memory/openrouter.env`
or the Docker `--env-file` argument):

```env
LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compat
AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
AI_MEMORY_LLM_COMPAT_STRICT=true
```

Then verify:

```bash
ai-memory llm-test --provider openai-compat \
    --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash --prompt "Reply with OK"
```

`AI_MEMORY_LLM_COMPAT_STRICT=true` sends OpenAI-style
`response_format=json_schema` for every structured call. Modern hosted
gateways honour it; some model backends (DeepSeek among them) otherwise wrap
their JSON output in markdown fences that ai-memory's tolerant parser has to
strip, which occasionally drops a field. Setting it to `true` at the
env-file level is safer for consolidation reliability. Turn it off
(`AI_MEMORY_LLM_COMPAT_STRICT=false`) only for a specific model backend that
explicitly rejects the schema-constrained shape.

The `docker/.env.production.example` file in the repo ships with an OpenRouter
setup pre-filled (with `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` as the sample model — see the
gotchas below for why reasoning models are ineligible). Model ids follow
OpenRouter's `provider/model` convention. There is no built-in default:
`AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL` is required, as it is for every `openai-compat` endpoint.

### Choosing a model

For LLM selection guidance, see
[`llm-provider-comparison.md`](llm-provider-comparison.md) — the project
maintains its own A/B testing there on consolidation quality, latency, and
cost. That comparison uses English consolidation fixtures and covers the
recommended default (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`), the cheaper alternative
(`openai/gpt-5.4-mini`), and the reasoning-model ineligibility note; the
OpenRouter subsection here defers to it rather than duplicating rankings.

For workloads dominated by non-English content, community reports suggest
that a higher-recall multilingual embedder (for example `baai/bge-m3` via
the `openai-compat` embedder) noticeably improves retrieval quality
relative to the built-in English-only local embedder. Configuration is in
the embedding paragraph below.

ai-memory automatically layers OpenRouter's app-attribution headers
(`HTTP-Referer` and `X-Title`) whenever the base URL points at
`openrouter.ai`, so ai-memory traffic is credited on OpenRouter's app
leaderboard. `AI_MEMORY_LLM_HEADERS=HTTP-Referer=https://example.com,X-Title=my-app`
overrides them per operator. `AI_MEMORY_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` is honoured on
this path: OpenRouter hosts receive `reasoning: { effort, exclude: true }`.

OpenRouter's LLM/completions API is what ai-memory uses above. It does **not**
reliably expose an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint — historically it
has not — so do not assume an OpenRouter base URL works for the embedder. If a
given deployment of OpenRouter does offer an embeddings endpoint, verify it
answers the standard `/v1/embeddings` shape (`curl` the endpoint directly)
before relying on it. When it does, configure the embedder through the
openai-compat path — not the openai path, which has an OpenAI-specific key
precedence chain:

```bash
export AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai-compat
export AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
export AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL=baai/bge-m3
export AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIM=1024
# LLM_API_KEY is reused automatically when EMBEDDING_API_KEY is unset on
# the openai-compat embedder path; no second key is required.
```

`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIM` is mandatory for openai-compat embeddings and must
match the model. For English-only content the built-in local
sentence-transformer (`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local`, see
[`local-embeddings.md`](local-embeddings.md)) is a valid alternative that
avoids hosted egress; for non-English content, a multilingual hosted model
(`baai/bge-m3`, `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`, or similar) served by any
provider that exposes a real `/v1/embeddings` endpoint is the practical choice.
The two endpoints are still independent, so setting `AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL`
alone does not redirect embeddings — set `AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` too.

### Security and gotchas

- **Bind address vs. port publish.** When running inside a container, the
  process-level bind (`--bind 0.0.0.0:49374` or similar) does not decide
  who can reach the port — that is decided by the container's publish
  spec. `-p 127.0.0.1:49374:49374` restricts to loopback on the host;
  `-p 49374:49374` publishes on every host interface. If the port is
  ever reachable beyond loopback, generate a bearer token first:
  ```bash
  ai-memory generate-auth-token
  export AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
  export AI_MEMORY_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<host,host,...>
  ```
  The server logs a loud startup warning about non-loopback exposure
  without a token; treat it as blocking. `AI_MEMORY_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
  guards against DNS-rebinding. TLS termination is expected to sit in
  front of the process — see [`docs/https-via-proxy.md`](https-via-proxy.md).
- **Secret hygiene.** The env file that holds `LLM_API_KEY` (and any
  provider-specific key you set) should be `chmod 600` and outside any
  directory a version-control tool sees. If you back up
  `~/.config/ai-memory/` (see [`docs/backup.md`](backup.md)), exclude
  the env file — the sample script and mirror `.gitignore` shipped
  there already exclude `*.env` by default.
- **Cheap models can drift.** LLM consolidation writes durable wiki
  pages, so a model that occasionally fabricates a `kind: decision`
  page for a session that made no decision leaves a page in the wiki
  that ai-memory will treat as first-class evidence on subsequent
  reads. This is a known cost of running a smaller / cheaper model on
  the consolidation prompt. Spot-check
  `<data_dir>/wiki/<workspace>/<project>/decisions/` during the first
  week on a new model for pages you do not recognize; if any appear,
  either raise the provider tier for consolidation only (keep the
  cheaper model for retrieval reranking) or unset
  `AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER` to fall back to the deterministic
  rule-based path.
- **`:free`-suffix models draw from a shared quota.** Any model id
  ending in `:free` on OpenRouter is served from a pool shared across
  all users of the free tier, not the caller's paid budget. When that
  pool is exhausted, requests fail with an upstream-shared-pool
  rate-limit error. Fine for evaluation, unreliable for production;
  prefer a model listed with multiple upstream providers on its
  OpenRouter page.
- **Reasoning-mode models are ineligible for consolidation.**
  Consolidation and lint use a strict-JSON output contract; reasoning
  models route most of their token budget through internal reasoning
  and either stall past the 300 s per-request ceiling or return empty
  strings. `docs/install.md#llm-provider-tiers` has the standing "what
  we don't recommend" note listing the pattern; the same applies to
  any OpenRouter model flagged as a reasoning/thinking variant. Prefer
  a non-reasoning peer for `AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL`.

`anthropic-oauth` hits the same `/v1/messages` endpoint as `anthropic` but
authenticates with an OAuth bearer token instead of an API key. Run
`claude setup-token` once, then set `AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic-oauth` and
`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token>` (or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, which `claude
setup-token` writes automatically). No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is needed. The Docker
wrappers forward either token by name to short-lived helper commands such as
`llm-test`; configure the long-lived server container separately as shown in the
installation guide.

For both Anthropic providers, ai-memory omits `temperature` for Claude
4.7 and later models and Claude Mythos Preview because those models reject
non-default sampling parameters. `llm-test` sends the same representative 0.2
value as the normal pipeline before the provider applies that compatibility
rule.

**⚠️ Unofficial and against Anthropic's usage policies — use at your own risk;
it may get your account rate-limited or banned. See
[the warning in `docs/install.md`](install.md#anthropic-via-claude-subscription-oauth).**

`copilot` stores a GitHub user token in the same auth file, exchanges it for a
short-lived Copilot API token via GitHub's `/copilot_internal/v2/token`, and
uses the Copilot Chat endpoint with `vscode-chat` integration headers. You can
also set `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` on the server.

For small-context local models, configure both consolidation limits. The input
target accounts for the complete rendered prompt, including bounded slot and
current-page context plus the structured-output schema; the output limit is
sent to the provider. Their sum must fit the model context window, with extra
headroom because provider tokenizers differ:

```toml
[consolidation]
max_input_tokens = 6500
max_output_tokens = 1000
```

The equivalent environment variables are
`AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION__MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` and
`AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION__MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`. Provider failures during an
automatic PreCompact/PostCompaction checkpoint fall back to the deterministic
rule-based page; admission, storage, and scope errors still fail closed. The
validated minimums are 6,000 input and 1,000 output tokens.

Every chat provider bounds each completion request at 300 seconds
(`AI_MEMORY_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECS` to override, or `llm_timeout_secs = 900` in
config.toml; the quick openai-oauth token refresh keeps the default ceiling).
The default tolerates a local engine cold-loading a large model; slow hosted
gateways whose long completions exceed the ceiling fail every request with
`http: error sending request`, so raise the value there instead of watching
consolidation exhaust its retries.

Reranking is optional and off by default. With an LLM provider configured,
`AI_MEMORY_RERANKER=llm` makes project and explicit-scope `memory_query`
calls over-fetch from the hybrid stage, fuse scopes, and make at most one LLM
call to reorder the best candidates. This can promote a relevant page that
RRF ranked below the requested cut, at the cost of LLM latency and usage. The
request sends the query plus at most 30 bounded page titles and search snippets
to the configured provider; all values are JSON-encoded and treated as
untrusted data. A timeout, provider error, or incomplete/invalid score set
preserves the normal order. `global=true` and supplemental global-preference
hits keep their existing non-RRF ranking. Concurrent provider calls are capped
at four; saturated queries keep their local ranking without waiting.

Embeddings are optional and separate from the LLM provider. Set
`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`, `voyage`, `google`/`gemini`,
`openai-compat`, or `copilot` when you want vector retrieval in addition to
FTS5 + entity + graph-neighbor retrieval. `openai-compat` targets self-hosted
engines (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM): it needs no API key and requires explicit
`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`, `AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, and
`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIM`. The optional `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` credentials the
embedder alone and is checked before `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `LLM_API_KEY`, so
embeddings can run on a different provider than the LLM. Because the two
endpoints are independent, `AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL` redirects only the LLM;
set `AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` as well or embedding traffic still goes to
the embedding provider's default endpoint. Both the FTS-only and
hybrid paths apply the same bounded page-authority adjustment after candidate
generation; embeddings improve relevance recall but do not decide which source
is canonical.

Asymmetric embedding models — ones trained with a different instruction for
queries than for the text being indexed — need that instruction added to the
text itself; the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` wire format has no field
for it. `AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_QUERY_PREFIX` and
`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DOCUMENT_PREFIX` (only applied by the `openai` and
`openai-compat` embedders) are prepended to query and document text
respectively, before the existing truncation, so a long body is still
truncated to the same overall input cap with the prefix included. Both are
empty by default — no behaviour change when unset — and are not trimmed, so
a publisher's trailing space is preserved exactly. For example, NVIDIA's
[`nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16)
(2048-dim, served locally through vLLM/`openai-compat`) specifies
`"query: "` for queries and `"passage: "` for documents per its model card:

```toml
embedding_provider = "openai-compat"
embedding_model = "nvidia/Nemotron-3-Embed-1B-BF16"
embedding_base_url = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
embedding_dim = 2048
embedding_query_prefix = "query: "
embedding_document_prefix = "passage: "
```

Base E5 models (`intfloat/e5-base-v2`, `e5-large-v2`, multilingual E5, …)
use the same `"query: "` / `"passage: "` convention. Instruction-tuned E5
variants and Qwen3-Embedding instead need a task-instruction string on the
**query side only** — their documents are embedded plain, with no document
prefix — but the two use **different exact spacing**, confirmed against
each model card:

- `intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct`:
  `embedding_query_prefix = "Instruct: {task description}\nQuery: "` — a
  trailing space after `Query:`.
- `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (and the other Qwen3-Embedding sizes):
  `embedding_query_prefix = "Instruct: {task description}\nQuery:"` — **no**
  trailing space; the query text follows the colon directly.

Fill in your own task description for `{task description}`, leave
`embedding_document_prefix` unset for both, and don't copy one model's
exact string for the other — the trailing-space difference is
publisher-specified, not a typo.

Changing `embedding_query_prefix` alone never requires re-embedding: only
`embedding_document_prefix` is folded into the stored embedding identity
(a non-empty value changes what `ai-memory` treats as the current
`{provider, model, dim}` triple for that page's vectors), so a document
prefix change makes `memory_query` stop matching the old vectors and the
next `ai-memory embed` (scheduled or manual) pass re-embed them
automatically — no `--force` needed. `--force` remains useful to
re-embed everything immediately rather than waiting for scheduled
backfill, or to force a re-embed for a reason the triple alone doesn't
capture (e.g. touching up the vLLM server's tokenizer or quantization).

`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=copilot` reuses the same Copilot OAuth login as
the `copilot` LLM provider (`ai-memory auth login copilot` or
`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_COPILOT_API_TOKEN`) — no separate API key.
It defaults to model `text-embedding-3-small`, dim 1536, and calls Copilot's
`/embeddings` endpoint following the same OpenAI-compatible contract Copilot
documents for chat. That endpoint's exact shape is not covered by a live
test against Copilot here; treat it as needing a real-Copilot smoke test
before relying on it in production.

`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=local` needs no key and no server at all:
sentence embeddings run in-process (pure-Rust `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`,
384-dim), with the model fetched once into `<data_dir>/models/` under
pinned checksums — see [`docs/local-embeddings.md`](local-embeddings.md).

See [`docs/install.md#llm-provider-tiers`](install.md#llm-provider-tiers)
for env vars and Ollama/OpenRouter/Atlas Cloud/OrcaRouter/Cheaper Inference/API Route
examples, and
[`docs/llm-provider-comparison.md`](llm-provider-comparison.md)
for the empirical model comparison.
