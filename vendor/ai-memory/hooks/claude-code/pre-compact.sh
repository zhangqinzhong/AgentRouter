# if found, appends marker query params to the URL so the server
# applies the declared workspace/project/strategy instead of
# bucketing by basename(cwd) under the default workspace.
# At runtime (after `install-hooks --apply`) `_lib.sh` is staged
# alongside this script. From the source tree it lives one dir up.
