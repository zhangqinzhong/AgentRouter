# Claude Code SessionStart hook.
# 1. Forwards the event JSON to the ai-memory server (fire-and-forget).
# 2. Synchronously fetches the pending cross-agent handoff and prints
#    it to stdout — Claude Code prepends `session-start` stdout to the
#    next session, so the resuming agent sees prior context with no
#    human in the loop.
#
# Walks up from the payload's cwd for a .ai-memory.toml marker file
# and appends cwd plus marker query params to both URLs — so a session
# resuming under basename or marker-declared routing doesn't query the
# wrong bucket and miss its own handoff.
# At runtime (after `install-hooks --apply`) `_lib.sh` is staged
# alongside this script. From the source tree it lives one dir up.
