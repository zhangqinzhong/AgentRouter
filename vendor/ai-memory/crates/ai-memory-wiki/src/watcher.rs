//! Filesystem watcher with debouncing and a periodic reconciliation pass.
//!
//! Two parts work together:
//!
//! 1. **Debounced events** via [`notify_debouncer_full`]. When a markdown
//!    file under the wiki root is created or modified, we read it from
//!    disk, parse the frontmatter, and `reindex_page` against the store.
//!    Own-writes are absorbed by the store's sha256 short-circuit, so
//!    the loop terminates after one no-op reindex.
//! 2. **Reconciliation tick** every 30s walks the entire wiki tree and
//!    reindexes page markdown files (excluding `_meta.md`, bootstrap files,
//!    raw event ledgers, and symlinks). Catches any events the OS dropped
//!    (basic-memory #580 — file watchers go stale under FSEvents buffer
//!    overflow, hidden-dir globs, etc.). Hidden-directory paths are
//!    explicitly NOT skipped (#798 lesson).
//!
//! Deletions are not reconciled (see #929): the watcher only handles
//! create/modify events, so a page whose file disappears stays indexed until
//! `ai-memory delete-page` removes it explicitly.
//!
//! A reindexed page version — new file or rewrite alike — is embedded the
//! same way `write_page` embeds one, via `Wiki::embed_page_version` (#929):
//! before, only pages written through the API got embeddings, and a
//! watcher-driven rewrite's new version silently had none until a manual
//! `ai-memory embed`.
//!
//! The watcher never *writes* to disk — that loop would be unbounded.
//! External writes drive store updates; internal writes drive disk +
//! store updates via [`Wiki::write_page`].
