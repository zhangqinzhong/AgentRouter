//! HTTP admission webhook chain — engine's *only* extension point for
//! enriching/validating pages just before persistence.
//!
//! ## Design (OCP)
//!
//! The engine ships ONE generic primitive: a chain of HTTP webhooks invoked
//! synchronously inside [`Wiki::write_page`](crate::Wiki::write_page) AFTER
//! the [`Markdown`](crate::Markdown) is built but BEFORE [`crate::emit`] +
//! atomic write. Each webhook receives the page (path + frontmatter + body)
//! and an [`AdmissionContext`] (actor identity + workspace/project scope),
//! and may:
//!
//! - Return `200 OK` with a mutated `{ page }` → engine substitutes
//!   `frontmatter` and/or `body` before persistence.
//! - Return `204 No Content` → no mutation, chain continues.
//! - Return `4xx/5xx` → behaviour governed by the webhook's
//!   [`FailurePolicy`] (`Ignore` = log+skip; `Reject` = abort the write).
//!
//! Each new domain extension (`contributors`, `cost-tracker`, `git-mirror`,
//! `review-marker`, …) becomes a NEW external HTTP service — engine never
//! grows for new fields/behaviours.
//!
//! ## Loop prevention
//!
//! Callers may set [`AdmissionContext::skip_webhooks`] from the
//! `X-Memory-Skip-Admission-Chain` request header — that lets a webhook
//! that calls back into the engine (e.g. to write a derived page) opt out
//! of being re-invoked on the recursive write.
