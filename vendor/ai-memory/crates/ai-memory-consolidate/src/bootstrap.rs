//! Pre-load an existing project's history into the wiki.
//!
//! The use case: a developer has been working on a project for
//! months. They install ai-memory today. The wiki is empty. The
//! first few sessions are net-zero (you're populating, not
//! retrieving) because none of the project's prior decisions /
//! gotchas / architecture notes are in ai-memory yet — even though
//! they're written down in `git log`, README, `docs/`, and module
//! doc-comments.
//!
//! `bootstrap` does a one-shot LLM-summarisation of those sources
//! into seed wiki pages so the project starts with warm context.
//! Pages are tagged `bootstrapped_at: <ts>` in their frontmatter so
//! a future lint pass can treat them as lower-confidence than
//! session-grown pages if needed.
//!
//! ## Cost model
//!
//! Input is capped via `max_input_tokens` (CLI default 150k). We
//! estimate token count locally at chars/4 and drop lower-priority
//! sources first when over budget. Large bundles are split into
//! sequential LLM chunks (`chunk_input_tokens`, default 24k) so
//! provider context limits are not exceeded.
//!
//! ## Idempotency
//!
//! First write produces `<wiki>/<workspace>/<project>/bootstrap.md`
//! recording the run (timestamp, source counts, generated page count).
//! Re-running refuses unless `--force` is passed. The user can always
//! delete the manifest (and the generated pages) to reset.
