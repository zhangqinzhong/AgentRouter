//! M8 forget sweep — episodic-only retention pass.
//!
//! Walks the `is_latest = 1` pages for a project, computes the retention score
//! for each via [`ai_memory_store::retention_score_with_breadth`],
//! and evicts those below threshold through the wiki layer: the authoritative
//! Markdown file is removed and the exact latest row becomes a decay
//! tombstone. Semantic / procedural / working tiers are skipped (M8 policy:
//! semantic compounds, only episodic decays). Pinned pages (schema flag OR
//! `pinned: true` in frontmatter) are exempt regardless of tier.
//!
//! TTL pass: pages whose frontmatter `expires_at:` is in the past are
//! hard-deleted through the wiki layer (file + rows), regardless of
//! tier or pin — an explicit expiry is a more explicit user statement
//! than a pin. `memory_lint` warns about pinned+expiring combos so the
//! contradiction is visible before the delete lands.
//!
//! Hard-delete pass cleans up tombstones older than
//! `hard_delete_after_days` and their supersession ancestry. Ordinary
//! supersession rows are safe because only a tombstone (decay eviction, or
//! the watcher's opt-in reconcile-delete safety net, #929 — the two are
//! deliberately indistinguishable here) writes `superseded_at`. A page
//! rewritten at a tombstoned path re-links onto that chain via `supersedes`
//! and clears the old row's `superseded_at` (`ops::upsert_page_in_tx`'s
//! resurrection path), so the old version becomes an ordinary, protected
//! chain member instead of an orphan this pass would otherwise hard-delete —
//! this is what keeps a reconcile tombstone's false positive from being
//! permanently destroyed once the file reappears.
//!
//! Observation prune pass (opt-in, disabled unless
//! `ObservationRetention::days > 0`) deletes raw observations older than the
//! configured age, and only for sessions already distilled into a page that is
//! still live. It runs LAST so both of this run's page deletions are already
//! visible to its predicate: a session whose summary page was evicted or
//! hard-deleted by the passes above keeps its raw capture, because that capture
//! is now the only surviving copy.
