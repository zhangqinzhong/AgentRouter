//! Subprocess smoke tests for `[auto_scope]` env-var configuration.
//!
//! These tests assert the wiring between figment's `AI_MEMORY_*` env-var
//! parser and the `[auto_scope]` config block. The chart values.yaml will
//! ship the same env vars (`AI_MEMORY_AUTO_SCOPE__MODE`, …), so a regression
//! here would silently downgrade prod from `per_session`/`per_actor` to
//! the legacy `single` slot — and we'd only catch it by smoke-running
//! against a multi-actor scenario in prod.
//!
//! Each test spawns the `ai-memory` binary with one env-var combination,
//! waits for the startup log line that records the resolved mode, and
//! kills the child. Invalid values trip a clear-error exit, which is
//! also asserted so figment's parse-failure path stays loud.
