//! Local spool for lifecycle-hook events — decouples capture from the network.
//!
//! Per-tool-call hooks (`pre-tool-use`, `post-tool-use`, `user-prompt-submit`)
//! append an event here (an instant local write) instead of POSTing
//! synchronously. The spool is drained to the server at **session boundaries**:
//! a cleanup pass at `session-start`, detached background flushes at
//! cancellation-prone boundaries (`stop`, `pre-compact`, `session-end`), and a
//! small threshold-triggered catch-up on busy `post-tool-use` streams. A few
//! seconds of latency is acceptable at boundaries, unlike the per-tool-call hot
//! path, which must never block the agent.
//!
//! This makes capture reliable against a remote/slow server (no event is lost:
//! a file persists until the server answers 2xx) without ever blocking a tool
//! call. It also fits ai-memory's model: consolidation runs on `session-end`,
//! after the drain has delivered the session's observations in order.
//!
//! Each event carries its own auth so a single global spool can hold events
//! for several instances: a static token is stored inline (file mode 0600);
//! an OIDC event stores only the mode and is resolved + refreshed from
//! `auth.json` at drain time (so a token that expired while the event waited is
//! renewed rather than rejected).
