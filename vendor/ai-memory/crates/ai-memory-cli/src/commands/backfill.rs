//! `ai-memory backfill` — one-time import of a project's pre-hook local history.
//!
//! Capture is forward-only: hooks record events only from the moment they are
//! installed. If you have worked in a project for weeks and only now install
//! ai-memory, the tool that exists for cross-session continuity starts
//! amnesiac about the very session you are resuming. This command fills that
//! first-boot gap: when the project's store is **brand new (empty)**, it
//! imports the existing local harness transcript history once.
//!
//! For each local native session it **replays the transcript through `/hook`**,
//! the same ingress live capture uses (as the companion importer does for
//! external conversations):
//!
//! - `export_transcript` (ai-memory-workstream) reads the harness's native
//!   transcript read-only into a normalized, bounded visible-event ledger,
//!   doing all the per-harness parsing in one place;
//! - each event is posted to `/hook/batch` as a session-start, `user-prompt`,
//!   or backfill-extension observation, attributed to the original harness and
//!   its native session id — so it becomes a real session + observations that
//!   consolidate into pages and are searchable via `memory_query`, exactly like
//!   live capture. The server **sanitizes and bounds every event**, so
//!   retroactive text crosses the same trust boundary as live capture.
//!
//! (An earlier revision imported through the managed-workstream begin/finish
//! endpoints, but that populates the `ai-memory run` continuity ledger, not the
//! searchable memory pipeline — verified by a live smoke where the observation
//! count stayed zero. `/hook` replay is what makes the history recall-able.)
//!
//! Safety: the automatic path only ever bootstraps an **empty** project (never
//! overwrites an established one — hook capture from install-time forward and
//! backfill of before-install history do not overlap), and it runs at most once
//! per checkout (a local sentinel).
