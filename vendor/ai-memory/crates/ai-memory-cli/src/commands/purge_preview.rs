//! Shared best-effort dry-run preview machinery for `purge-project` and
//! `purge-session`.
//!
//! Both subcommands refuse without `--confirm`, but first ask the server for
//! a bounded preview (`"dry_run": true`, which wins over `confirm`
//! server-side) of what the confirmed run would do. The HTTP round trip, its
//! timeout, and the classification of the result into "print this" vs "stay
//! silent" are identical between the two commands — only the request body's
//! shape, the endpoint path, and the summary line's wording differ, so those
//! stay in `purge_project.rs` / `purge_session.rs` and this module holds only
//! what would otherwise be copy-pasted between them.
