//! `ai-memory-web` — read-only HTTP browser for the wiki.
//!
//! Mounted under `/web` on the same axum server that hosts the MCP
//! endpoint, so a single port + single auth posture covers both. The
//! crate is deliberately read-only in v1: no editing, no POST routes,
//! no agent-write APIs. The wiki is already markdown-on-disk; this
//! surface just makes it browsable from a phone, a tablet, or a
//! teammate's machine without `docker exec cat …`.
//!
//! Routes (all under whatever prefix the host nests this router at):
//! - `GET /`                              → project list (cards)
//! - `GET /w/:workspace/:project`         → page tree + recent activity
//! - `GET /w/:workspace/:project/p/*path` → rendered markdown + metadata
//! - `GET /search?q=…`                    → FTS5 hit list
//! - `GET /pending`                       → root-only pending-writes triage;
//!   its buttons post to `/admin/pending-writes/*`, not to this crate
//! - `GET /login` / `GET /change-password` → public human-auth HTML forms
//! - `GET /static/*`                      → embedded CSS + logo (public)
//!
//! The companion `api_router` exposes the same read-only data as JSON
//! for custom frontends. It intentionally does not expose write/admin
//! operations.
//!
//! Theme follows `prefers-color-scheme` via the included Tailwind
//! stylesheet; no JS toggle, no cookie.
