//! Authorization middleware for the HTTP server.
//!
//! Machine-only routes (`/mcp`, `/hook`, `/handoff`,
//! `/workstream/*`) accept `Authorization: Bearer` only. Browser
//! routes use Bearer plus one of two mutually exclusive modes:
//!
//! - before human password auth is configured, GET requests retain
//!   the deprecated Basic / `ai_memory_auth` cookie transport;
//! - after human auth is configured, only short-lived human sessions
//!   authenticate browser requests.
//!
//! When no authority is configured the middleware is a no-op,
//! preserving zero-config loopback.
//!
//! Comparison uses [`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`] so an attacker on the
//! same LAN cannot use response-time leaks to recover the token byte
//! by byte.
