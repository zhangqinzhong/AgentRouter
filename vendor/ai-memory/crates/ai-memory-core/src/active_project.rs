//! A process-shared pointer to the project the user is currently active in.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (issue #2)
//!
//! The MCP protocol carries no working-directory context: a `memory_query`
//! call arrives with its arguments and nothing else, so a tool handler has
//! no way to know which project the agent is sitting in. The lifecycle hooks
//! *do* know — lifecycle `/hook` events carry the agent's `cwd`, and the hook
//! router resolves it to the correct per-cwd `(workspace_id, project_id)`.
//!
//! In HTTP mode the `/hook` ingress and the `/mcp` endpoint live in the same
//! process, so the hook router can publish "the project the user is currently
//! active in" to this shared pointer when work starts or advances, and the MCP
//! tools can read it as their default instead of falling back to the server's
//! static `--project` (which defaults to `scratch` and made the read tools
//! return empty memory even when the hooks were correctly populating a real
//! project). Completion events refresh exact actor-scoped entries only; a
//! delayed tail from an older session must not redirect a shared fallback.
//!
//! ## Isolation modes
//!
//! The default `Single` mode keeps the historical behaviour — one process-
//! wide slot, last-write-wins. That is right for a single operator running
//! one project at a time, but collapses parallel sessions on shared installs:
//! a hook firing from `~/repo-A` overwrites the slot a concurrent
//! `memory_query` (with no explicit project) in `~/repo-B` was about to read.
//!
//! Opt-in modes keep a per-key map alongside the single slot:
//!
//! - `PerSession` keys by `session_id` — isolates concurrent agent runs of
//!   the same operator (one person with several Claude Code / Codex windows
//!   in different repos at once).
//! - `PerActor` keys by `(user, session_id)` when both coordinates are present
//!   and also keeps a user-only slot for requests that truly have no session
//!   coordinate. That isolates across operators while preserving per-session
//!   isolation for clients/bridges that do forward one. Pairs with multi-user
//!   mode (rung 2): `user` comes from the `users` row that owns the bearer
//!   token.
//!
//! When the caller has no actor identity at all (anonymous request without a
//! session, or a code path the migration has not threaded yet), every mode
//! falls back to the single slot for backward compatibility. That is a legacy
//! convenience, not isolation. If a request provides a usable actor coordinate
//! and the keyed lookup misses, `get_for` returns `None` instead of falling
//! through to another session's latest project; callers then use their baked
//! default or an explicit workspace/project. The single slot is also what the
//! historical `set` / `get` / `clear` API touches, so existing callers compile
//! unchanged and admin ops like `move-project` still invalidate the pointer
//! correctly.
//!
//! ## Memory bound
//!
//! Per-key entries carry an [`Instant`] insertion timestamp and are evicted
//! on read or write once they exceed the configured TTL (default 1 hour).
//! A hard `max_entries` cap (default 4096) drops the oldest entries when
//! exceeded, so an adversarial / runaway client cannot grow the map without
//! bound. Both knobs are exposed via the CLI's `[auto_scope]` config block.
//!
//! ## Locking
//!
//! Locks are held only for the microseconds it takes to copy a small tuple
//! or do a single hash lookup; callers never `.await` while holding them, so
//! plain `std::sync::RwLock` is the right primitive (no async lock needed).
