//! Per-request actor identity — who triggered an operation.
//!
//! ai-memory's wiki is single-tenant (no per-page RBAC; everyone with auth sees
//! the same pages), but writes can be **attributed** to the user who made them.
//! Operational session and handoff state is owner-scoped so one operator
//! cannot accidentally finalize or consume another operator's live context.
//! [`ActorContext`] is the typed carrier for that identity, injected once
//! per request by the auth middleware and threaded through to the writer
//! actor so attribution lands in the same SQL transaction as the data.
//!
//! ## Resolution rungs
//!
//! 1. **Anonymous** — no `Authorization` header configured at all.
//!    `ActorContext::default()` (all fields `None`). The pre-multi-user
//!    behaviour; backward-compatible for every existing single-user setup.
//! 2. **Identified single-user (root)** — `AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` matches
//!    `config.auth.bearer_token`. Middleware fills `user` / `email` / `name`
//!    from `[auth].root_username` / `root_email` (and optional `root_name`).
//! 3. **Identified multi-user** — bearer token matches an active
//!    `api_credentials.token_hash` row. Middleware fills the actor from the owning user.
//! 4. **External auth proxy** — a trusted sidecar authenticates with the
//!    dedicated proxy bearer and asserts a username or complete OIDC
//!    issuer/subject pair in `X-Memory-Actor-*` headers. Proxy callers are users
//!    unless the stable OIDC pair exactly matches the configured root pair.
//!
//! ## Why not RBAC
//!
//! ai-memory v1's data model is single-tenant by design. Attribution
//! records *who* did a write; it does not gate *whether* they could do it.
//! That keeps the engine focused on "shared memory for a household /
//! small team" without bringing in roles, groups, or per-page ACLs.
//!
//! ## Field choice
//!
//! Every field is `Option<String>` so:
//! - `Default::default()` is a valid anonymous actor (no allocation).
//! - Partial identity (e.g. agent known via hook payload, user not yet
//!   authenticated) is representable.
//! - Serialised payloads omit absent fields rather than emitting `null`
//!   noise — see the `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`
//!   attributes.
