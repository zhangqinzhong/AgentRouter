//! Cross-agent handoff type.
//!
//! A handoff is a typed snapshot of "where we are" — created when one
//! agent CLI ends a session, accepted when the next one starts in the
//! same project. Stored explicitly (vs. inferring from the
//! observations log) because cross-agent continuity is the project's
//! headline feature and deserves a first-class schema.
