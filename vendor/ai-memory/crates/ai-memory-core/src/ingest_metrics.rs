//! Process-lifetime counters for the hook ingestion pipeline.

//! Lives in `core` rather than `hooks` because both the hook router (which
//! writes these) and the admin status route (which reads them) need the
//! type, and `ai-memory-mcp` deliberately does not depend on
//! `ai-memory-hooks` outside dev-dependencies. Putting it here keeps that
//! boundary intact instead of adding a production edge between them.
