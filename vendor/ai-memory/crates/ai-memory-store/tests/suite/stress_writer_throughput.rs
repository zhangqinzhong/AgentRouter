//! How much load the single writer actor absorbs before it becomes the
//! bottleneck — measured, not estimated.
//!
//! All writes funnel through one actor over a bounded `mpsc` channel, which is
//! the right design for SQLite but does make one question worth answering with
//! a number: at what point does a shared server stop keeping up?
//!
//! This is the `stress` tier: the everyday nextest profile skips it and
//! `-P full`, the pre-push hook, and CI run it. The measurement itself is also
//! `#[ignore]`d so a throughput number never becomes a flaky gate on a loaded
//! runner; run it on demand:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo nextest run -p ai-memory-store -E 'test(/stress_writer_throughput/)' --run-ignored all --no-capture
//! ```
