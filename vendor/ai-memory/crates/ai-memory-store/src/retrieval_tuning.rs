//! Opt-in post-fusion ranking signals for `hybrid_search`.
//!
//! Two bounded, independently switchable signals, both off by default so a
//! store that never configures them ranks exactly as before:
//!
//! * **Session-recall routing** — a zero-LLM lexical check that recognises
//!   queries phrased as "find a past session / what did we do back then"
//!   ("上次 / 之前那次…的会话 / last time / yesterday …"). Session pages
//!   otherwise carry a bounded authority penalty (kind `session` −0.15,
//!   tier `episodic` −0.08, ×0.77 combined) because they are rarely the
//!   right answer to a fact query — but a query that is *about* a past
//!   session needs one. When the routing fires, the penalty is handed
//!   back plus a small bonus, still inside the authority bounds every
//!   other page lives in.
//! * **Abstract vectors** — a fifth RRF stream over
//!   `page_abstract_embeddings`, the embedding of a page's frontmatter
//!   `abstract:` line (the L0 layer). A one-line summary embeds far more
//!   sharply than a multi-thousand-character body, giving the vector side
//!   a precise second vote per page. Contributes nothing while the table
//!   is empty.
//!
//! Both signals are reported in `SearchExplain`, so an `explain=true`
//! query can account for the returned rank.
