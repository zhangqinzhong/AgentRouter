//! SQLite persistence for the auto-improvement loop.
//!
//! The consolidate crate reviews a finished session and produces *proposals*
//! (create/update a wiki page). This module stores those proposals with a
//! full audit trail so an operator can approve, reject, or fail them later:
//!
//! - `auto_improve_runs` — one row per review pass, with provider/model,
//!   warnings, and the rejected-candidate list for telemetry.
//! - `auto_improve_proposals` — staged page edits plus a snapshot of the
//!   target page at stage time (`*_at_stage` columns). Approval re-checks
//!   that snapshot and returns [`ApproveAutoImproveProposalResult::Conflict`]
//!   instead of clobbering a page that changed since staging.
//! - `auto_improve_proposal_events` — append-only status history per
//!   proposal (`staged` / `approved` / `rejected` / `failed` / `conflict`).
//! - `auto_improve_rejections` — normalized rejection records with a
//!   whitespace/case-insensitive fingerprint so the telemetry report can
//!   spot the same proposal being re-staged and re-rejected.
//! - `auto_improve_scheduler_state` / `_claims` — the session-end scheduler
//!   watermark and per-session claims that make the background reviewer
//!   idempotent across restarts.
//!
//! All mutations run inside a transaction on the caller's connection; the
//! writer actor owns that connection, so the single-writer invariant holds.
