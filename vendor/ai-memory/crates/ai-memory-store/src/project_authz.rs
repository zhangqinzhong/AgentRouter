//! Per-project authorization choke point (#708).
//!
//! On a multi-user server, attribution ([`ai_memory_core::ActorContext`]) records
//! *who* made a write but does not gate *whether* they were allowed to touch a
//! given project. This module is the single typed decision point that closes
//! that gap. It is consulted by [`crate::ScopeResolver`] read/write resolution
//! (the one place every scoped MCP/API/web path funnels through) and by the
//! writer actor as defense in depth for writes.
//!
//! ## Open until an operator restricts
//!
//! The V68 schema is additive and every project defaults to `open`, so this is a
//! pure pass-through until the root operator opts a project into `restricted`
//! (`ai-memory project access`), or sets `[auth] new_projects_restricted`. The
//! gate short-circuits to ALLOW for:
//! - a deployment that does not distinguish operators (single-user / loopback),
//!   where there is no notion of "another user" to gate against, and
//! - any `open` project.
//!
//! ## Never fail closed on a resolution gap (#678)
//!
//! A `restricted` project with **zero** grants still admits root and the
//! project creator — an operator is never locked out of their own data. If the
//! grants table cannot be read (an older schema mid-migration), the decision
//! degrades to `open` with a loud warning rather than denying every read.
//!
//! ## Invariant #16
//!
//! This is an *authorization* check that returns allow/deny for **entry** to a
//! project. It is never an [`ai_memory_core::OwnerFilter`] on page rows and it
//! never scopes page reads by user: a team with grants sees the same shared
//! pages. `pages.author_id` must never become a read filter.
