    // unreachable orphan. For a reconcile tombstone that "no chain has a
    // successor" is exactly what made it eligible for

/// `compact` deletes nothing, `forget-sweep` only hard-deletes the ancestry of

/// the DB-only state an operator is trying to keep. One reported store reached
/// 6,539 versions and 14 GB of ledger rows for 101 live pages.
///
/// Every one of those rows is a byte prefix of the version after it, so
/// deleting them loses nothing the file on disk does not already hold.
///
/// # Scope: a path is a ledger only if its content says so
///
/// The filename gate alone is not enough, and getting it wrong is the
/// expensive direction: a prose page a human named `log-2026-09.md` wears the
/// same shape as the ledger, and deleting its version chain destroys a real
/// page's history (invariant #16 — a divergent write supersedes, it does not
/// destroy). So the shared content gate from
/// [`ai_memory_core::log_ledger`] decides, and it is the same gate the
/// indexer, the OKF migration and the bundle export use. A real page's
/// supersession chain is never a candidate.
///
/// # Derived rows
///
/// Nothing is deleted by hand. `page_embeddings`, `links`,
/// `cross_project_links`, `entity_page_links` and `page_feedback` all carry
/// `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `pages`, and `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is on, so one
/// delete takes the vector, link, entity and feedback rows with it.
///
/// # Why the FTS delete trigger is dropped
///
/// `pages_fts` is an external-content FTS5 table, so dropping the trigger
/// would leave the deleted rows' tokens in the index. Re-issuing them through
/// the trigger is what makes an ordinary delete work — and on these rows it
/// means re-tokenizing tens of gigabytes of ledger body, one row at a time,
/// which is the cost the reporter hit. So the trigger's own SQL is read from
/// `sqlite_master`, dropped for the delete, and re-executed afterwards, and
/// `pages_fts` is rebuilt wholesale. Reading the DDL back rather than
/// restating it keeps this honest if the index's shape ever changes again.
///
/// # `drop_latest`
///
/// Since #660 the indexer skips ledgers, so each ledger's live row is also
/// left over from before the fix. It is kept by default — it is the version
/// the file on disk corresponds to, and dropping it is the operator's call,
